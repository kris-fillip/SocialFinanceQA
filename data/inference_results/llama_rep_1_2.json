        "question": "ELI5: Why do banks lend at such a low rate for mortgages? On PF we often talk about earning 7% on stocks, or 5% on bonds in the long run. If bonds for example are a fairly safe investment, why would any lender bother to sell a mortgage that only earns say 3.125%, when they could invest it somewhere else for a higher return? Especially once you consider that mortgages have some overhead (paying loan officers, accounting systems, advertising, etc) and significant risk of default.\nObviously lenders aren't idiots, so how do they make a good return lending at such low rates?",
        "prediction": " Is there something I am missing here? Thanks! \u2013 cnst May 8 '09 at 14:46\n@cnst - There is no \"low\" rate as far as bankers/lenders are concerned. They charge what they can get away with charging. It has nothing to do with whether borrowers will pay their loans back; its all about supply & demand. And if someone wants your money more than you want his, then he gets it. \u2013 JTP - Apologise to Monica\u2666 Nov 16 '10 at 22:19\nThe problem isn\u2019t the interest rate per se but rather the cost of capital associated with the transaction. The amount of time spent by underwriters, lawyers, processors, appraisal staff, notary personnel, marketing materials, mailings, title searches, tax records, inspections, environmental studies, construction plans\u2026and finally closing costs like origination fees, recording fees, courier charges, transfer taxes, attorney fees, escrow fees, flood certifications, fire department reports, and other assorted expenses. These add up quickly even though the total dollar amounts may be small compared to the price paid for the property.\nThese expense also include fixed costs which must be covered regardless of the volume of business done each month. For instance, an office building lease payment cannot simply be reduced because fewer people come into work every day. Likewise, salaries still need to be paid even if revenues decline significantly. So while the actual dollar value of these operating costs may go down from one year to another, the fixed component does not change much over time. This means that if sales drop off dramatically due to a recession, the company needs to reduce expenses elsewhere just to break-even. In addition, companies usually plan ahead several months and spend heavily during periods where things look rosier in order to increase future revenues and profits. But this requires them to hire additional employees who will take home checks throughout the next quarter or two. As a result, many companies end up spending too much money early in the cycle and cutting way too deep later on. Consequently, most financial institutions continue operating right through tough times until everything collapses around them.\nWhen lenders start offering zero percent financing, they lose control completely. Their ability to manage assets becomes severely limited since customers now know exactly what prices should be charged without having any idea about how much labor went into producing those goods. Since there is no longer any profit margin left after subtracting out variable costs, consumers become reluctant to buy anything unless absolutely necessary. With nobody willing to accept lower quality products anymore, producers stop making new models altogether resulting in widespread unemployment across industries everywhere. Once enough jobs disappear along with consumer confidence levels plummeting below critical thresholds, entire nations collapse economically speaking. That leads us directly into today\u2019s economic crisis which began well before anyone realized exactly what was happening behind closed doors within Wall Street firms themselves.\nTherefore, although mortgage rates seem ridiculously high relative to current inflation rates, keep remembering that they represent only part of the overall equation used to determine pricing strategies employed by various types of service providers worldwide. While everyone loves getting free stuff whenever possible, sometimes giving something away causes problems further downstream especially considering the fact that few people understand fully how complicated markets really operate. After all, it takes quite a bit more effort to create wealth via entrepreneurship instead of simply waiting patiently outside stores hoping somebody hands him some extra change. Unfortunately, however, most individuals tend towards passivity given half chance thereby allowing others to exploit weaknesses found among large groups of humanity.\nIn short, don\u2019t expect anyone working inside corporate offices anywhere near Chicago Illinois USA North America Western Hemisphere Earth Solar System Milky Way Universe known galaxy beyond our own local cluster of galaxies located approximately three billion light years distant according to recent estimates made using advanced telescopic equipment deployed aboard spacecraft launched earlier this decade exploring nearby regions already mapped extensively thanks largely owing primarily mainly totally solely exclusively entirely almost completely nearly wholly mostly pretty much kinda sorta maybe somewhat possibly conceivably likely probably surely undoubtedly unquestionably confident certain assured positive secure dependable trustworthy reliable stable constant durable lasting permanent solid stiff strong mighty powerful firm steady sure steadfast immovable imperishable incorruptible indestructible eternal infinite boundless immense gigantic gargantuan enormous huge tremendous vast gigantic titanic mammoth monstrous ginormous",

However, there are some things we can discuss in general terms...\nFirst off - why do you want to keep this? Is it because you like having a large amount of death benefit protection ($25K)? Or perhaps because you think it has good investment potential given current interest rates? Maybe you just don't feel comfortable surrendering it after seeing all these blogs talking about poor returns over long periods of time? Do you see yourself getting more coverage down the road? If one of those reasons resonates with you then maybe you should consider holding onto it.\nHowever, if none of them seem applicable then let me ask you something else... How much money does it take to buy a car? A house? A wedding ring? Take a look at how much money you spend each year on non essential items. Now compare that number to the annual cost of maintaining your policy. It probably doesn't take too long before you realize that you could put away the same amount of money into other accounts and still come up with enough funds to cover whatever expenses arise during your lifetime. At which point you no longer need the life insurance anymore anyway right? So now you're left wondering where all that extra money went that used to go towards paying for your life insurance. What did you decide to do with it instead? Did you save it? Buy stocks? Put it toward your mortgage principal? All great choices; however, they only work if you actually end up doing them rather than spending the money elsewhere first.\nIn short, yes you definitely should evaluate your situation carefully to determine if this is really necessary for you anymore. You say you already have adequate term life insurance through your job, so that takes care of protecting against financial loss due to early death. And even though you mention that you were diagnosed with a health issue several years ago, most companies offer guaranteed acceptance plans specifically designed for people who suffer from certain conditions such as yours. They typically aren't cheap either though since their purpose isn't meant solely for income replacement purposes. Instead, they focus mainly on providing immediate relief upon passing away by helping settle funeral costs etcetera along with covering medical bills accrued prior to demise via reimbursement programs offered under specific circumstances. Either way though regardless of exactly HOW old someone gets sick, once he reaches retirement age generally speaking almost everyone becomes eligible again simply based upon being alive & breathing.\nSo yeah, ultimately it comes down entirely depends on personal preferences regarding risk tolerances versus reward expectations vis-\u00e0-vis future earnings opportunities vs present day needs plus budget constraints currently held within existing savings account balances combined together across multiple banks nationwide spread throughout America itself......\nThank you very much for taking the time to respond. This information helps tremendously! :)",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the life insurance industry. Under no circumstances do you cancel that policy before you have another in place, even if you have term through work. Most new policies have a \"contestability period\" where if you pass away, your family can receive only the premiums paid into the policy depending on how you died. After the contestability period ends, the insurance company has to pay the insurance value of the policy.\nWhole life is meant to cover solely funeral expenses, something your family will have to pay for no matter how long you live. Term is meant to cover short term needs like income replacement, mortgage, child care expenses if your wife has to go back to work if you die unexpectedly, etc. \nPaid-up insurance means you are guaranteed $12,000 of life insurance for the rest of your life in exchange for forfeiting the $800+ cash you would get if you cancelled the policy. And you wouldn't have to pay another dime. I would love to see a modern day policy where you can get $12,000 future money for your family in exchange for paying $800 now. It doesn't exist for a 28yr old with a pre-existing condition. \nThe other wonderful thing about paid-up policies, especially the older ones (you'll have to check the way the policy itself is written) is that after a certain number of years they often start earning cash value again. Pretty much the insurance company takes that $800 cash value, reinvests it, and it makes them money. The old policies \"rewarded\" the policy holder for that by paying interest(dividends) back onto the policy in the form of additional cash value. Which you can then use to increase the insurance value of the policy if you choose to. \nYours isn't old enough to work quite as well as this example, but I've seen policies that were originally bought to cover maybe $500 or so, the policy holder paid about $50 in premiums before the policy became fully paid, and when they finally passed, their family got a few thousand dollars. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you pay more attention to the growth, that's approximately a 4000% growth on the original premiums. \nIf your patient and maintain a whole life policy correctly, especially one that was taken out when you were a child, those things can pay back a lot of extra money when you pass than what was originally paid into them in premiums. \nMy recommendation is to find someone who can walk you though all the specific options of your policy. If it is an insurance agent, make it extremely clear that you have no interest in exchanging it for a new policy (even if you are thinking about it in real life), you just want to understand how it works and your different options. A lot of insurance agents still work on commission, so do not let one of them try to pressure you into cashing it out in favor of a brand new policy. Not all of them are like that, but there are some that only care about their sales goals and not what's best for you and your family. ",
        "answer_2": "Why not go to an investment advisor and ask for a free comparison? Most advisors are also in the insurance business or have a business partner who is...\nFor that matter, why not go to a second advisor after that? Compare notes on what they can do for you and think about it. \nRemember that new life insurance has a \"free look\" window, so you can keep the old whole life policy for a little while, as you consider you're options. I, for one, would tell you to keep your current policy as is, but an advisors job is to gather all the pertinent questions and give you a straight answer.\nOne important question: Have you considered family insurance?"

Either way, once you\u2019re no longer living at home or dependent upon them financially\u2014which sounds like will happen fairly soon based on your plans\u2014then they won\u2019t be able to force you into giving up ownership rights unless they physically harm one person holding joint title on said property/account(s). However even then most states require some kind written agreement signed by everyone present agreeing otherwise prior before transferring ownership interest anyway (so keep those receipts!) Otherwise just call banks every few months reminding them which accounts belong solely yours alone ;) Hopefully someday soon we stop having problems like these altogether tho\u2026\nIt seems unlikely that they would use money to \"manipulate\" you. It is more likely that they are concerned about losing control of funds belonging to other family members. The solution is simple--have each party sign a document stating clearly who owns what percentage share in the account. Once done, ask the bank to change the name on record accordingly.\nThe law does allow minors to earn wages but prohibits employers from paying less than minimum wage rates set forth in state statutes governing labor standards.[1][2].

You should budget around $200 a month for food unless you eat mainly home cooked dinners. Then again, even eating home made meals doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t run into any surprises along the way like birthdays parties or unexpected bills coming due during the same period.

However there are many other options available outside these accounts which allow higher contributions including:\n\u2013 SEPs/SIMPLEs (which have much larger annual caps)\n\u2013 HSAs (for healthcare expenses)\nIf you\u2019d prefer to stick within the traditional & roth ira structure though, just make sure any extra funds go towards either a regular taxable brokerage account or even better, some sort of employer sponsored plan such as a 401k where possible since those offer both large annual maximums AND generous matching benefits from your company!

Isn't someone getting paid to clean up and stuff so money is still flowing like usual? or is money leaving our country or something?",
        "prediction": "\nI think you are thinking of a \"cost\" in terms of dollars, whereas what they really meant was that there would be an economic impact on the region where the storm hit (or maybe even beyond). The cost might not actually involve spending any real cash at all, but rather it could just represent lost productivity as people can no longer go about their daily business because of damage caused by the storm - e.g., roads may have been flooded out, buildings damaged/destroyed, power lines down etc.. In other words, this isn't necessarily a financial loss for anyone per se; instead these sorts of costs tend to manifest themselves through reduced output from workers who aren't able to produce anything due to conditions being unsafe or unsuitable (i.e., if your house gets blown away then obviously neither you nor anybody else living nearby has much use for furniture anymore!) So while some individuals certainly do benefit financially during times like these thanks largely because insurance companies pay them compensation based upon how much property got destroyed plus whatever extra expenses were accrued along with repairs needed afterwards--this doesn't always translate into overall profits though since many other factors come into play such us inflation rates which affect consumer demand levels causing prices across various industries fluctuate wildly over short periods without warning!\nELI5: Why are we so scared of asteroids hitting earth?

I initially told our realtor that we have a limit at 275,000 but recently have been feeling like we can go higher and still be comfortable while saving money. \nI was hoping you fine folks here could help me figure out that range?

You can read more here: http://www.myfico.com/CreditEducation/FicoScoresFAQs.aspx#15\n\nThe reason being is that there are multiple versions of the model used by lenders so if you have one version then another has different numbers. In addition each person's data will vary depending on their individual circumstances. So what might seem like a low number could in fact be high enough but with less than perfect payment history or other factors such as collection accounts etc. The best way to get your actual scores would be through TransUnion where you pay $20 per month and receive updates weekly. This will give you access to all three bureaus along with your VantageScore 3.0 - https://transunioninsights.com/products-services/creditmonitoring/. However this isn't necessary because most banks offer free online services nowadays. My bank gives me full reports every year without asking anything else from me except perhaps some personal info when signing up initially. Other options include LendingTree who also provide free monitoring plus alerts whenever changes occur across various sites including Experian & Equifax among others (though these aren't official scores). Another option would be using AnnualCreditReport.com which allows users to request copies once annually at no cost.

He shows how expected returns are higher for risky assets when inflation expectations increase or decrease rapidly. Thus, while the rate of return on safe assets remains low over time, there will always be periods where safe assets have high rates of return. If you think about it from a portfolio perspective, your goal should be to hold both types of securities - those whose prices go up due to changes in interest rates (safe) and those whose price goes up regardless of what happens to interest rates (riskier).\nThe problem with holding only one type of security is that if something bad were to happen such as increased inflation/deflation expectations, then all of your wealth could disappear since your entire portfolio was invested in just one thing. By diversifying across different kinds of assets, however, you protect yourself against unexpected events happening during any given period of time. As long as each kind contributes positively towards total returns throughout history (and assuming equal weights), then no matter what happens overall performance won\u2019t suffer too badly even though some years might see poor results relative others.\nAs far as why people buy into these ideas despite evidence showing otherwise... well sometimes things aren't clear cut right away; especially after decades worth of data accumulates!

        "question": "Is there a point in negotiating with insurance company if I have GAP insurance on a total car? I got into a wreck last week and my insurance company said it's totalled. I owe about $4,500 on it and I don't imagine the car itself is worth that (2002 Honda CR-V). I looked around and it might be worth $3,500-$4,000. We did get GAP insurance for it when we got it and my wife insists there's a point in negotiating a higher payout from the insurance even though we have GAP (she says that if we have to use GAP to pay the rest off, we won't get anything for a down payment on another car). Is there a point? Is there a way I can combine them to get enough on a down payment for another car?\nBonus question: Anyone have tips on how to negotiate with insurance companies for a higher payout? This is my first time dealing with insurance companies to this extent and I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.",

Thanks so much!! :)\nposted by fuzzypeggy to Travel & Transportation (17 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite\nGap coverage only covers the difference between your loan amount and the value of the vehicle at the time you bought it - not its current market value. If your loan was less than half the original cost of the car then gap will cover most or all of any deficit. But since you're already over halfway through the life of the loan they probably aren't going to offer you very much more money based solely on the fact that you had gap coverage. The best thing you could do is sell the car privately rather than take an insurer settlement. You should still be able to make up some of the shortfall out of pocket using funds from the sale. Just keep in mind that a salvage title means nobody else is going to want it unless you are willing to drop the price quite low.\nIf you need cash fast but don't want to deal with private sales consider selling to one of those buy here/pay here places where they give you credit against future purchases instead of giving you cash right away.\nAs far as negotiation goes, the easiest approach is just to call the adjuster who handled your claim and ask him directly \"What kind of deal am I getting?\" He'll tell you straight out whether he thinks you've been treated fairly or if you ought to push back harder. That being said, he may be wrong and you may actually end up better off after haggling yourself. It depends entirely upon his experience level relative to yours.\nBest answer: My husband totaled our truck recently, and we were surprised to find that without gap insurance we wouldn't receive nearly enough to replace it. Insurance paid us something ridiculously small -- maybe $6K while the book value was somewhere closer to $9K. After reading everything online and talking to various people, I decided to try asking for double the amount offered me initially ($12k), which seemed reasonable considering the condition of the car and its age. They came back offering slightly under $8K. So now we are trying again, saying we think we deserve a bit more because of the state of the car, and they agreed to reconsider their initial offer...so fingers crossed we'll come out ahead soon.\nAlso, depending on the type of car, etc., you may also be eligible for additional compensatory damages above and beyond normal replacement costs, such as lost trade income due to having no access to your car during repairs, rental expenses, and other things. Check your policy carefully before signing anything, however; often these types of claims must be filed within 3 months or whatever period of time your insurer has specified. Also check to see if you have uninsured motorist coverage available--that's usually included automatically but isn't always, unfortunately.\nI hope you get a good outcome, too! Good luck.\nResponse by poster: Thank you both SO MUCH!!! I really appreciate your responses.\nMy wife was concerned that the insurance would look bad if she tried to argue for more money given that we have gap insurance. She feels that the insurance company shouldn't care either way. I'm glad to hear that it doesn't matter either way. And yes, it seems like the loan amount was more than half of what the car originally sold for. So that makes sense why they'd say 'nope'.\nRegarding the second part, thank you! We haven't received the paperwork yet, so I guess once we start arguing about it, we'll figure out exactly what the terms are. If it turns out that we CAN'T sue someone else, does that mean we have to settle with the insurance company and accept whatever they offer us? Or can we refuse and continue fighting until we reach a fair agreement?\nThanks so much everyone! :)\nposted by fuzzypeggy at 7:33 PM on June 18 [1 favorite]\nYou might want to talk to your attorney about this. Your attorney can advise you about what your options are and what course of action you should pursue.\nYour lawyer might suggest suing the driver responsible for causing the accident, assuming you weren't at fault.

        "answer_1": "You're not going to get anything for a down payment on a replacement vehicle if you're upside down in a car loan, period.  So there's no point in negotiating unless you can get the insurance payout to be MORE than you owe on the car WITHOUT the gap insurance.\nIf you owe $4500 on a car worth $4000 and it's totaled, you will get a payout of $0.  All gap insurance does is prevent you from still having to pay that last $500 on a car that no longer exists.  The hard truth is that you have no equity in your car for the insurance company to pay out.",
        "answer_2": "If you can get your insurance to pay more than $4500, you keep the extra and can use it as a down payment.  If your insurance pays $4500 or less, gap will make up the difference but you won't have any extra for a downpayment.\nOdds are if your car is worth $3500-4000 you are unlikely to be able to negotiate a settlement of over $4500.  But wait and see what their offer is, if they come in higher than expected you might be able to get a few hundred."

In my opinion, getting the MBA is more about the achievement factor than anything else, but there's obvious risk in getting an MBA from a program that has 0 graduates (as it's new).\nI work for a major bank in Pennsylvania and do not plan on moving for the foreseeable future, probably at least 3-4 years ahead until my wife is tenured in the PA Education system and we can move together. My boss and his boss are both supportive of my plans to get an MBA, and I'll continue in my current role with no adjustments.\nI guess my question now is, should I do it? Should I pursue something else? Any reason not to do it (other than lost opportunity to do something else, plus the fun of working and school simultaneously)?",

A brand-new program is worth less than $0, since there is no network and the school has no reputation.\nThat's not to say that you have to go to Stanford or Harvard for an MBA to make sense, but a brand new program is way too far down the other spectrum.",

        "question": "(US) Just got in touch with a Dave Ramsey ELP. What are the questions I should ask them regarding my financial planning? Over the weekend, I was researching financial planners in my local area, and I decided to give one of Dave Ramsey's ELPs a shot. \nI got a call from one of their agents this morning, and I told the gentleman that I was considering talking to a financial planner for advice on investments and planning for the future etc. \nI said I will email them back with a list of questions I have. I was wondering if there is anything in particular I should ask a financial planner to ensure that the advice they give me is for my benefit and not theirs, or rather how do I make sure that this particular financial firm is not pushing products that end up making more money for them than for me. \nYour advice is appreciated. \nThanks. \nEDIT - \nI sent the following mail to the firm: \nHello,\nAs I mentioned in my earlier email, I have a few questions I wanted to ask you before I could make a decision.

My house rental has been my main source of income during this time while I was moving around. I supplement it with teaching online but the income is too low. \nI currently rent out my house for $2000 a month which is located in Suburban/not great area of Los Angeles. \nI want to raise the rent a little but terrified my tenants will move out.

(saying they stay for years to come)\nC) Deal with potential time without income if it doesn't rent right away.\nHonestly, I wouldn't risk it, if the rent was a good chunk of income for me without a plan lined up. Such as new tenants (maybe old friends son wants to get out on own) or having a nest egg if it went unrented for months without anyone there.\nNobody likes rent going up, so I assume the original renters won't be so cool if the rates raise. \nFor me though, if the renters have been  there for this long and are good. (Minimal repairs and damages) I would just keep things the way they are for it works. Food for thought.",
        "answer_2": "Since you are remote and can't manage this property yourself, I'd higher a property manager.  They can let you know what the current rental market is and help you find new tenants if you need to that will pay market rate.  The property manager will probably charge you something like 5% of the rent, but it will be worth it since you won't have to deal with anything.\nThink of it this way. Through inflation alone, $2000 in 2007 is worth $2500 today.  So even if your rent just kept up with inflation, it should be higher today by $500 a month.  "

My SO received a job offer in March, and we traveled to that city to look for houses several times in order to move in early Sept.

Is this even possible, and if so, how would we go about it?\nI have not informed this agent about the new situation yet. She expects to make between $9,000 and $15,000 from commission if I understand the commission process correctly.",
        "prediction": " We are looking at the low end here because our initial budget was much lower than what we ended up spending (due to the market being more expensive). It's probably safe to say that an additional amount like that wouldn't be too much of stretch for them financially - they can certainly use it since their hours must be pretty long considering all the effort involved. But I don't know enough about real estate commissions to really figure out where exactly things stand or what kind of money they could expect. The other thing is, as you may imagine, I feel weird asking someone for a sum of money when they didn't do anything wrong! They went above and beyond by far, but I still worry that it feels odd. What should I do instead? \u2013 user26874 Apr 3 '17 at 1:22\n@user26874 \"They went above and beyond\"... you need to pay them accordingly then :) You will never get anywhere in life if you try to save every single penny.. \u2013 Dheeraj Varma Apr 3 '17 at 1:27\nThis question might benefit from some clarification regarding whether the OP has already asked the brokerage firm to cover the costs associated with their search efforts. If he hasn't done so yet, then he shouldn't bother trying to negotiate something directly with his agent -- simply ask the company covering those expenses to reimburse him. Otherwise, yes, the OP should absolutely seek direct payment from his agent. As others noted, agents typically operate independently of the firms they represent; most likely, any attempt to force your agent to accept less-than-full compensation would backfire against both parties. \u2013 Nate Eldredge Apr 3 '17 at 1:34\n@NateEldredge He hasn't asked anyone else to help cover these costs though. This whole scenario happened after we decided to cancel our plans to buy a house based on changing circumstances related to the job offer. So now we just want to give something extra to our Realtor, without involving anyone else. \u2013 user26874 Apr 3 '17 at 1:35\nYou should always thank people who helped you. And you should reward good service. Even if it isn't required. Just write them a check for whatever amount makes sense. Don't think twice. People appreciate getting paid. \u2013 JTP - Apologise to Monica\u2666 Apr 3 '17 at 1:40\nWhenever I sell property, I always tip my Realtors. They earn their commission well before closing day, and doing business with them is generally easy due to their experience helping previous clients. While tipping doesn't seem appropriate for buying a home, I think you owe the same level of gratitude to your Realtor. At minimum, send them flowers, maybe include a note expressing appreciation for everything they did.\nHow does one determine the value of such tips? Does one base it off the percentage of income earned vs time invested? Or perhaps based on the number of trips taken to show potential customers various locations? \u2013 user26874 Mar 30 '17 at 14:25\n@user26874: Well, if you are giving away gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars, you can't possibly afford to calculate their precise monetary values. ;) Seriously, though, I agree with the sentiment that gratuities are appropriate for services rendered. In addition, depending upon local customs, you may wish to provide something small as a token of thanks to everyone else involved in the transaction, including inspectors, lawyers, appraisal companies, etc. \u2013 keshlam Mar 30 '17 at 15:21\nIt depends entirely on your relationship with the Realtor. Someone who worked very closely with you to find a place, but failed ultimately to close, deserves recognition. However, unless you had a great rapport with the Agent, sending a gift seems excessive. There are many different ways to recognize someone who goes above and beyond. One way is to leave them a review online, another is to refer future friends / family members to them, or just tell them personally how grateful you are.\nIn general, leaving a cash tip would only come into play if you felt that the Agent took special care of you during the course of your homebuyer journey. For example, perhaps they gave you advice that saved you significant amounts of money later down the line. Maybe they arranged for repairs prior to closing that otherwise would have caused delays and frustrations. These types",

My wife and I live in Austin, TX and are interested in flipping homes here since the market is hot hot hot and doesn't show any signs of losing steam.

While we enjoy the monthly cash-flow from the duplex we are interested in buying distressed property (both SFR and Multi) and fixing it up, then reselling.  \nWe could probably gather about 100K in seed money, which I see as enough to place the 25% down on the first property, 10-20K in reno, and a large contingency fund.

        "question": "If the Chinese economy has been in a downturn, why have Chinese market ETFs been doing well? I\u2019ve found some Chinese market ETFs that I\u2019d like to buy when their economy is low and the ETFs are attractively priced. \nBut I was looking at their 1yr/5yr return graphs and they\u2019re still fairly strong. Why is that? I would expect them to show the price declining over time and being at a relative low point. \nDoes this mean nothing since share price can sometimes be manipulated by companies (splits, buybacks etc) and become an inaccurate indicator of company performance? or does it have to do with the ETFs still being listed under the NYSE and somehow being affected by the U.S.?",
        "prediction": "  \nI don't know about the ETFs specifically but you should look into whether the stock prices are falling because there is no liquidity available for those shares. It could simply not be possible to sell your holdings right now as many investors want out too so everyone will just keep buying until nobody wants to own anymore. You may need to wait several months before selling without taking any losses if things get really bad. The other thing to consider here is what kind of assets these ETFs actually contain - perhaps they only track certain indices which aren't necessarily representative enough of overall economic conditions within China itself; maybe one specific industry sector performed better than others during recent times while another suffered badly due its dependence on foreign markets rather than domestic ones...whatever happened along those lines might explain why returns were good even though everything else seemed awful!

If you have excellent credit (760 or higher), you can often qualify for an FHA loan with just a 3.5% down payment. That means that if your home costs $200,000, you could get financing for $191,000 without putting any money down at all!",
        "answer_1": "Bear in mind your mortgage is only a portion of your home expenses. Your Principle, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI) is a better estimation of home expenses. And then comes maintenance (a good rule of thumb is 1% of your home's cost per year averaged out over many years). \nLenders will potentially lend up to 50% of your gross for your PITI plus other debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans, etc). Some exceptions for even higher numbers. Some lenders will cut you off in the 43-45. You will also hear terms like front end and back end rations. The former deals with just the PITI while the latter considers all debt. For just your PITI, often cited numbers are 28% and 35%, or even 1/3rd. And then you have those who recommend you budget based on net income (usually 25% of net for the very conservative recommendations). \nSo should you go with 35% or more of your gross or 25% of your net? The answer really depends on your budget. Going over 25-30% of your gross will hurt your ability to save or spend elsewhere. But at the end of the day, the amount you can afford is determined by your spending habits. If you like to spend a lot on hobbies or vacations, 25% of your net may be too high. If you never go out, never go on vacation, and never spend, then maybe numbers beyond 35% of your gross make sense. \nThe short answer? Don't go over 25-30% of your gross on PITI without being absolutely sure it fits within your budget and is in line with your financial goals. Any number below 25-30% of your gross is probably fine if it fits your budget.",

Now some people push it and say it should be 30-35% after income tax is cut however that might be pushing it. In some cases, it might be even closer to 40% however the move above you go, the more you have to worry about being pushed towards the edge. I wouldn't recommend it go over 40% because you'll be squeezing your retirement funds because of it. So ideally try keeping it below 30-35% of your total gross income and I think most folks will be fine."

I live with my parents, and I don't currently have any real expenses beyond gas.  I am not in debt of any kind.  While my parents have been generous in allowing me to stay rent-free, and paying for my community college classes (I've been taking classes part-time since high school, I have roughly 2 full semesters under my belt), we don't get along great, and I really don't like where I live (Northern VA).  My plan is to move to the Denver, Colorado area within the next few months, after this semester finishes up in May.  I have an offer for an $18 an hour position doing the same job I'm doing now.

It was paid for in full, but my parents very generously paid for half of it.  I have yet to discuss selling it with them, but I'm operating under the assumption that they would in turn want half of the money I get from selling it.

I've been looking online for a while, and I'll probably be able to find one for not more than 5 or 6 thousand dollars.

Below is a rough plan I've come up with for where all that will go:\nRent: (up to) $700\nFood: $250\nCar Insurance: $150\nPhone: $50\nGas: $300 (I plan on spending most of my free time hiking and exploring the state, so I'm putting in a very high estimate)\nSavings: $500\nSpending money: $500\nI plan on using my savings for unforeseen expenses like car repairs or a broken phone.  My parents are currently paying for my phone and my car insurance, and they might be willing to continue to do so.  However, I'm not counting on it.  If they're willing to, that would be an extra $200/mo going to savings.  I'm going to be on my mother's health insurance plan until I'm 26.\nSo is this realistic? I've ran the numbers over and over, and I really do think it'll be feasible.  I know that a lot of the numbers I've provided are estimates, but I've done my best to make conservative ones.

        "question": "Being debt free finally feels real I am a long time reader first time poster. Would like to thank the community for all the wonderful information and inspiration. Some of the stories really kept me going.\nBackground:\nMale 34 not married.\nFriends thought i was weird for going on this journey.\nPaid off approximately 60K over 4 years (student loan, car, credit card, family loan). \nIncome was approximately $65K before tax.\nHave fully funded emergency fund of 6 months.\nContributing 15% to 401k.\nOpened and full funded a Roth this year. :)\nStarting to save for a house down payment.\nI used the Dave Ramsey method for the most part but I chose to save up a fully funded emergency fund before finishing off my last debt. Which was a loan from my family that I continued paying off monthly. The company i was working for at the time was not very stable so I put a higher value on having cash in the bank vs being debt free. \nOn Sept 2nd 2015 i finally felt safe enough to pay off the last 8K of debt. Hell Ya I am debt free. :) At this point I raised my 401K contributions to 15% from 6% as recommended.\nSo, the strange part for me was that I really did not feel very different after being officially deft free. I still feel very conservative with money and guilty about eating out or buying something nice for myself.\nOne of the things I wanted to do when I finished my journey was to give the Total Money Makeover book or FPU to those who could use it and showed interest.  I am excited to report that on Tuesday I gifted my first copy of the book to a friend who is a single mother working multiple jobs and still struggling with her finances.  After giving her the book for some reason it really hit me that I was debt free and also had a positive net-worth!  \nWhen I got home that night I logged into Vanguard and funded the remainder of my Roth  and opened a taxable account so I can start investing part of my future pay. Still trying to decide on how I want to celebrate. ;)\nDo you have any advice about being less conservative with money after becoming debt free? I still plan to keep a budget and saving, but I want to be less strict with myself.\nDo you have an interesting story about the moment when it finally clicked in your mind that you were debt free?",
        "prediction": " Did you make changes once you became financially independent?\nCongrats on getting out of debt!!! I think there's nothing wrong with feeling more relaxed now that you don't need to worry about making minimum payments anymore...but if you find yourself spending extravagantly every weekend then maybe try to cut back.\nFor me personally, even though we are technically debt free, I still stick to our budget because I hate seeing balances go negative - although they usually aren't since we only spend what we have left each month.\nAs far as finding balance between enjoying life while keeping frugality in check, I would say just live within your means and enjoy doing fun things without breaking the bank. For example, instead of staying at expensive hotels during vacation, rent a place through AirBnB or HomeAway. You get a much nicer space than a hotel room anyway, plus you're supporting local businesses by using these websites rather than big corporations. Or instead of eating at restaurants, cook dinner at home and take the leftovers for lunch the next day.\nAlso, I found that shopping online helps prevent impulse purchases better than brick & mortar stores. If I see something online that catches my eye, I will add it to my cart and come back later to buy it. This way, I can stop and reconsider whether I actually need/want whatever item I added. And sometimes, I end up forgetting altogether. It works well for me.\nPost by: SenseiShane on September 19, 2015, 07:08:31 PM\nQuote from: Bicycle_B on August 18, 2015, 10:37:46 AM\nMy DW has been telling me she wants us to move to Hawaii. She says \"we should sell everything.\" I replied, \"you mean liquid assets?\" Yes, she said. So, here goes: We own two cars worth around $10k combined. Our mortgage is paid off ($125k), and we have roughly another $150k in equity invested in rental properties. My wife says we should throw caution to the wind and quit our jobs, sell everything except one car, and move to Oahu. Her thinking is that she doesn't know anyone else in HI besides her brother and sister, so why not meet new people? Also, her parents retired there. I told her that sounds great, but where exactly does this leave us? I asked her if she knew anything about living costs in HI. Nope, she hasn't looked at anything yet. In fact, no research has gone into this decision at all. When pressed further, she tells me she knows someone who moved there recently and he loves it. I ask him what his cost of living expenses look like. He replies, \"it varies depending upon which island you choose\". That's helpful. Nowhere near specific enough. What does everyone else here think? Am I crazy to suggest we wait until we figure out where we might move, how much housing costs, etc., before selling our primary residence? Should I tell her that moving halfway across the world isn't a good idea unless we already have a job waiting for us, a place to live, and a solid understanding of the cost of living?\nYou may indeed be nuts :D\nWhat makes you think you won\u2019t ever run into trouble again?

        "answer_2": "Yes you absolutely should. SDCCU blows away every other bank I've ever used. The only time I've used another bank is when they offered me $300 or $500 to open up an account with them for a minimum of 3 months (Wamu did this, and Chase did this). So I did, then closed the account. I made $800 that way and they've learned their lesson.\nSDCCU isn't profit driven in the sense that all on paper profit is used to keep customer rates artificially low or expand their business - none of it is paid out to investors because there are none. They actually had the best brick-and-mortar mortgage terms every time I've financed and refinanced. Wells Fargo matched SDCCU except they tacked on $5K in closing fees for fictional things with fancy names - which SDCCU charged \"zero\" for. Other banks were even worse.\nThe only better choices for a mortgage/refi were online banks, where you take on a bit of risk because they can be flaky and can't be easily contacted for a problem (co-worker had his payments bounce with an online bank because the servicer changed mailing address and didn't even tell him, costing him real money and time).\nThe only disadvantage I ran into is SDCCU charged more for international wire transfer fees, than my wife's bank, which is not something most people will run into. But my wife's bank more than compensated by other shenanigans not unlike the Wells Fargo scandal.\nSDCCU does not do any of the BS Wells Fargo does. I have never had to speak to a single SDCCU employee about my money except when I initiated contact about something I wanted, and not a single change has ever happened to my accounts without my asking for it. They have never made a single mistake with my accounts, in 14 years.\nAlso, their employees are great. I have never felt any sales pressure from them. In fact, I've always felt their sales members were not aggressive enough. Always polite in informing me that my pre-approval has now expired just let them know if I want to try again some time. Very laid back.\nA world of difference with my wife's bank (first BoA, then Citi). Lots of WTF moments of getting new accounts we never asked for, getting screwed on rates on auto-renewal, etc.. I had to personally call them every 9 months to put my wife's money stored in CDs back into one of a higher rate because they will always auto-renew into the shittiest rate possible. It's not my money and I'm not even touching it, otherwise it would be sitting in one of \"my bank\" accounts which we share."

Probably a dumb question but how does my credit score know to increase based of my payments to landlord, it's all a physical transaction(giving a check/cash)?  Also do paying my cable,electric,gas,insurance,etc on time increase my credit score?\nThanks.",
        "prediction": "\n\nComment: Landlords are not obligated to report any information about you or the rent payment to anyone - including the major bureaus that compile consumer reports and scores. So no, they will never be able to help improve (or hurt) your credit score because there is nothing for them to use in order to calculate an accurate score from your rental history. In addition, many utility companies don't report anything either; however some may if you have problems with late payments...\n\nAnswer: Payment history makes up \\strong{50%} of your FICO\u00ae Score\u2609 so yes, by making timely payments to your landlord, electricity company etc., your score could go higher. However, I think what you really want to ask is whether those accounts should be included at all since they aren\u2019t reported to the three main reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax & TransUnion). They are only reported when something goes wrong like non-payment or other issues.\n\nHowever, having said this, you could still benefit from these types of accounts being added to your Experian Credit Report which is available free every month through our Boost\u2122 service. It provides access to both your VantageScore\u00ae 3.0 and your FICO\u00ae Scores as well as detailed explanations of why each one was calculated. This way you can see exactly where improvements need to happen in order to move towards better scores overall.",
        "answer_1": "It doesn't. It's obvious once you think about it, but credit scores are based on credit, or extending people money. Landlords don't lend you money, so even if your landlord was a big corporation which leased rooms and you paid by certified checks, it wouldn't help your credit.\nAs noted, it can hurt your score if you miss a utility payment - I suppose the reasoning is if you can miss a utility payment, you might miss a credit/loan payment as well.",
        "answer_2": "\nProbably a dumb question but how does my credit score know to increase based of my payments to landlord, it's all a physical transaction(giving a check/cash)?\n\nPaying by cash or check does not improve your credit score.\n\nAlso do paying my cable,electric,gas,insurance,etc on time increase my credit score?\n\nNo, but if you pay those bills with a credit card and then pay your credit card bill your score will gradually improve.  Always pay your credit card bill in full, every month.  Also note that some of those bills may have a surcharge for paying by credit card."

That said, if there was no way around it - then I guess that\u2019s how things are done. Maybe there are laws against it. But as far as I know, those brokerage firms do allow people/companies to withdraw funds from an active margin loan. And yes, banks typically block debtor attempts to get cash out of their checking account via ACH transfer or wire until certain legal requirements are met by the creditor before releasing the funds. I believe credit card companies also require court orders before allowing a merchant to pull funds off someone\u2019s CC balance. So maybe these same rules apply to stockbrokers too.",
        "answer_1": "Well 401ks are exempt from most forms of garnishment [by law](  so that's pretty much all there is to it. Debt collectors would be in deep shit if they tried. Not all investment accounts are qualified retirement accounts under that law though, so if you did have money in a taxable brokerage account they could go after it. \nI'm not sure exactly what the philosophy is but I assume it's that retirement income in old age is intended to be exempt so people can actually retire safely at some point. Same basic reason social security income is exempt.",
        "answer_2": "It does seem crazy that you can put your money into one account (retirement) that is legally protected against bankruptcy or collection agencies while other accounts are not. \nI believe the logic behind the law is that if the credit card companies could wipe out consumers retirement funds, there would be a lot more people on government assistance when they are too old to work.   The law that prevents credit card companies from raiding someone's retirement fund also acts as a safety net for those that get themselves in trouble with debt.\nIt does seem morally wrong that someone could declare bankruptcy and wipe out the debt that they owe while holding onto large sums of money in a retirement account, but then you consider what the lenders are doing.  \nLending companies have become more and more predatory.  In the past lenders used to focus on being paid back.   If someone had a month or two where they didn't pay, lenders would stop lending them more money and work out a payment plan to help them pay back the debt.   The opposite is true today.   If someone gets behind on payments, the credit card companies and banks salivate over the money that could be made off of this person by extending them more credit and sinking them further into debt.  Someone who is behind on their payments will have an increase in offers to take out loans or open new cards.   The days when going through bankruptcy ment you could never get approved for another credit card are gone.   Now, those who have just come through bankruptcy recieve the most advertisements to open a new credit card.   The people who can't pay their credit cards on time are the people the banks make the most money off of. \nBankruptcy & having protected accounts (retirement) seems unfair until you consider how unfair the system is to consumers.  It would be nice if they brought back the usury laws to stop the predatory lending."

        "question": "My fianc\u00e9\u2019s car was hit by another driver and now their insurance is refusing to pay. A woman veered into my fianc\u00e9\u2019s lane and damaged the side of her car which the estimates look to be about $3k -$4k (the car was purchased for $5k a year ago) the other driver admitted it was her fault to us and also told that to the state cop who showed up and wrote a police report that said it was the other woman\u2019s fault. Now however she told her insurance company that it wasn\u2019t her fault and it\u2019s been almost 5 weeks with no progress and my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have a reliable way to get to work and back. Is there any advice how this can be resolved. The other woman\u2019s car was not damaged at all but my fianc\u00e9\u2019s car door won\u2019t close and has large dents on the door.  Thank you",

It sounds like the other party may try to dispute liability if they think he caused his own damage because it happened while he was changing lanes or something similar. In such cases, I would recommend consulting with an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible so that evidence preservation can begin immediately before memories fade away and witness statements are lost forever due to lack of preparation time prior to trial date being set months down-the-road after everything else happens first; sometimes even years later depending upon court schedules & filings deadlines etcetera..\nQ: How do i know when its time to sell?\nI am looking to buy a house here in florida.\nA: You need to ask yourself what type of investment property will give me the best return over the long term. That might mean buying rental properties where tenants cover most expenses and leave some money left over each month, or perhaps purchasing homes outright from homeowners facing foreclosure who want cash instead of losing equity through bankruptcy proceedings.* Either option requires careful research into local markets before making any decisions though\u2014so make sure yours aren\u2019t just based off speculation alone.* As always remember too much risk isn't good either...if things go wrong financially speaking during recessions/depressions then having extra capital available could save lives* And lastly don\u2019t forget about tax implications either since selling high priced assets means paying higher amounts come April 1st every single year until retirement age kicks in*. *All information provided within these questions comes directly from sources deemed credible enough by myself personally including government agencies themselves (IRS).\nA: Your answer depends largely on whether you plan to rent out the unit(s), live in one of them yourself, or both. Rentals typically require more maintenance than living spaces do--and therefore cost less per square footage--but still provide income potential beyond basic mortgages paid off over time.* When considering renter vs owner occupancy scenarios keep these points top mind: Rentals often attract lower quality applicants compared with those seeking permanent residences due mainly because landlords tend toward stricter screening processes given their desire avoid expensive repairs related issues arising from poor management practices among others factors.* This makes sense since people looking solely towards owning real estate generally care little about finding someone willing take charge responsibility maintain property properly keeping costs low.* Therefore many individuals opt choose between two options rather stick traditional route offering flexibility choice between different types housing needs wants wants preferences life circumstances change unexpected events occur causing changes situation requiring adjustments accordingly.* However please note there exists third alternative known lease purchase agreements whereby prospective lessees agree assume full ownership rights title following completion payment terms specified contractual agreement signed mutually agreed parties concerned entities involved transaction process completed successfully finalized satisfied both sides end result achieved desired outcome reached goal accomplished satisfactory manner expected manner envisioned originally planned anticipated manner originally projected estimated amount calculated estimated figures determined accurate precise exact details verified authenticated confirmed validated true genuine legitimate factual truthful correct right proper appropriate suitable applicable acceptable feasible reasonable practical possible effective efficient sufficient adequate complete whole entire comprehensive total finished ended terminated cancelled discontinued aborted stopped ceased abandoned deserted discarded rejected cast aside forgotten ignored neglected passed over shunned ignored disregarded disrespected despised detested loathed hated desecrated defiled destroyed obliterated annihilated demolished razed ruined wrecked devastated ravaged pulverised crushed trashed smashed bashed hammered pounded battered thrashed thwacked walloped biffed whapped knocked around flattened squashed mutilated cut torn ripped gouged slashed stabbed hacked chopped chipped scraped scuffed dented scratched pockmarked punctured indented dimpled creased furrowed marked scored incised etched engraved embossed imprinted branded burned charred seared roasted grilled broiled fried steamed boiled water bath immersion deep fat pan sous vide oven microwave steam injection pressure cooker slow cooker crock pot instant pot rice cooker electric skillet barbecue grill open fire wood coal gas oil propane natural gas fuel cell nuclear fusion hydrogen fusion helium fusion nitrogen fusion argon fusion xenon fluorine neon radon radium polonium actinoids transuranics thorium protact",

        "prediction": "\nA Roth IRA is an individual retirement account that provides tax-free growth on your investments, as well as tax breaks for contributions. You can contribute up to $6,000 per year ($7,000 if you\u2019re age 50 or older). Contributions are not deductible but withdrawals after the age of 59\u00bd are free from federal income taxes (and in most cases state income taxes) A traditional IRA allows money to grow without being subjected to current income tax rates while it accumulates over time. The contribution limit is lower than a Roth\u2014$6,000 annually, plus another $1,000 catchup provision for those aged 50+.. If you qualify, there may be even more benefits available by contributing into both types of accounts at once. For example: If you want maximum flexibility when choosing where to keep your savings, then consider opening two separate IRAs instead of one joint account between spouses \u2013 this way each person gets their own individual access through their respective banks; however they should still share ownership rights under law so neither party feels like he/she has been cheated out because only half belongs exclusively them alone!\nWhat happens to my Traditional IRA when I die?\nWhen someone dies, their estate must go through probate court before assets can be distributed among beneficiaries.

No concerts for a while. No restaurants. I went way overboard and it's time now to just stop it. I can throw that extra money towards my credit card debt. I've also considered, instead of paying extra on my student loan payments, setting more aside for the credit card debt. I've returned all of the purchases that I can.

Also a charged off credit card from college of $450. \nMy question for this forum is how do you guys suggest I finance this security deposit and first month of rent for this new place, I will need 2,100 all together. I get two paychecks for $950 a month. I seriously do not know what to do and I am at my wits end. I currently have one roommate who I would ask to help but he is also a recent graduate and does not have a tremendous amount of money. I would ask my family, but as mentioned before I cannot because of the recent medical emergency.\nPlease if anyone has any advice let me know . I just would like some help and guidance to get out of this situation.",

        "question": "Endorsed IRS refund check lost in mail\u2013\u2013any recourse? My wife and I got a large tax refund check. We both signed the back, wrote \"For Deposit Only in [our Charles Schwab account]\" and mailed it with a deposit slip from WA to Charles Schwab's mail-in deposits address in El Paso, Texas.\nIt's been a month, and when I call Schwab they assure me nothing has been received. Like an idiot, I just sent it in a stamped envelope with no tracking or confirmation. They mentioned long delays in mail going to their Florida centers, but I remember clearly addessing it to El Paso.\nAny course of action to suggest?

It would be very difficult to steal one without leaving some kind of evidence behind... unless ofcourse you had written on the front which bank was supposed to receive it. In any case, try contacting Schwab again via phone and see what happens next time! Also read the article here about how much money can go missing between USPS delivery times etc.. \u2013 Dheer Jul 17 '16 at 8:04\nI don't think you should worry too much about this. You made sure that only you could use the check and also gave instructions to the post office. If something happened to it along the way, then you will likely never know since it isn't possible to trace where exactly it went after being given to the postal service. However, even if the check does arrive late, you still get your full amount due anyway because the government will always honor its own checks up until the date specified. The fact that you used certified mail is a good thing though because now you do have proof of sending and receiving dates. This may help prove later if anything goes wrong.

        "question": "Warren Buffet Bond Valuation? Not sure what to make of this from Buffett's letter to shareholders:\n\"Originally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000 face amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called \u201cstrips\u201d). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 \u2013 a bit less than 64\u00a2 on the dollar \u2013 with the $500,000 payable in ten years. As the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were purchased) delivered a 4.56&37; annual return if held to maturity. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I originally intended to do no more than tally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017. 12 After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012, our bonds \u2013 now with about five years to go before they matured \u2013 were selling for 95.7&37; of their face value. At that price, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1&37;. Or, to be precise, .88&37;\"\nIsn't the amount earned at maturity fixed? I assume the bond has already been purchased, so why would the selling percentage relative to face value matter any more- the $500,000 gain has already been guaranteed?",

Holding the strip for 5 years earned him $0.32, and holding it for another 5 years would earn him another $0.04. He chose to sell the strip for $0.96 instead of waiting 5 years for it to be worth $1.00",
        "answer_2": "I'll try to better explain why he could sell it for so much in 2012.\nTo make the math simple, let's say that the 2018 interest rates on bonds are 10%. You could buy a 2 year zero coupon $1 bond for $0.83, because earning 10% interest, it would be worth $.91 in 2019, after one year, and $1 in 2020 after two.\nNow lets assume that the market rate for bonds in 2019, goes down to 5%. 1 year zero coupon bonds are selling for $0.95 on the dollar. Although my original bond should only be worth $0.91, I can sell it for $0.95, because the going interest rate dropped so much."

        "question": "How do I verify the legitimacy of a landlord? Wife and kids and I are moving to Phoenix AZ from out of state. We've always rented from property management companies (3rd parties). \nWe found a place on realtor.com from someone claiming to be the owner. We got a video walk through and like the place, and want to proceed.\nQUESTION: How do I verify that this is legitimate, and that I'm not going to deposit into some random guy's bank account the first and last months rent plus deposit? It makes me a little nervous...is there any way to safely proceed without risk (we're unable to visit before the move)\nEdit and UPDATE: thank you for all of the replies. It's weird there wasn't one easy solution to verify something this important. He ended up using cozy.co, which I've never used but in my mind added some validity. The application had us get a credit report and background check...it felt pretty official. We also looked up the deed on the county's website and found he was the property owner with his wife. The other thing was we talked to him multiple times with various questions and he sounded legit. I know that's not a real objective measure but it's that intangible aspect that helped a little. My wife didn't want to ask for his ID and I was fine with that. She also doesn't want to do the extended stay. We may regret that but we'll only be there a year or so. We'll probably end up going forward with the lease, even though I'm still not 100% sure I guess. Not sure we can be (I'm maybe 97.3% sure). Thanks for the ideas and help thinking this through.",

You could try asking your current landlords if they recommend anyone else who might be available locally and then go talk to them face-to-face at their office/place of business. If they seem sketchy, don\u2019t sign anything until you feel comfortable. Or just wait till you arrive!\nYou should definitely look at the deeds yourself - those will show what properties belong to whom. But keep in mind that people sometimes sell houses to themselves under LLC names, etc., and it takes some digging around to figure out how things actually work.

Is it because he has more control over tenants? Is it cheaper for him since no middleman fees? Does he plan to live in the unit himself?\nIf none of these reasons seem plausible, run away fast.\nposted by bleep at 5:10 PM on June 28 [1 favorite]\nHow did you find this person? Did you meet him personally? Was he able to give you references from past clients? What kind of guarantees does he offer? These are the kinds of questions you need answered BEFORE signing ANYTHING.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with dealing direct with the landlord; lots of homeowners choose to advertise \"For Rent\" signs rather than use a broker or agency. However, you absolutely must interview and vet the potential new landlord thoroughly prior to entering into a contractual agreement. This means meeting them FIRST. Asking detailed questions such as where exactly is the money being held during the period between leasing and occupancy. Who pays utilities? Do you pay rent late charges? Can I sublet my room? All of these questions require specific written responses AND verbal confirmation of said responses. Don't accept vague promises. Make the individual provide you with documentation showing proof of ownership of the building(s), proof of funds availability, contact info for referees (previous clients preferably)...and then followup with each reference to ensure the information provided matches what you were given.\nDo NOT ever send payment via wire transfer services like Western Union or Paypal -- you lose all recourse once sent electronically. Cashier checks and personal checks are okay IF YOU HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PAYING WITH THAT CHECK OR THE ACCOUNT NUMBER ON WHICH IT IS DRAWN FROM. NEVER SEND COD (cash on delivery) or certified mail payment methods UNLESS YOU ALREADY MEETED THE PROSPECTIVE NEW OWNER FACE TO FACE AT LEAST TWICE, ASK QUESTIONS REGARDING EXACTLY WHERE THE CHECK OR MONEY ORDER GOES WHEN MADE OUT BY BANKS ETC, AND THEN FOLLOWUP AFTER DELIVERY WITH VIDEO CONFIRMATION THROUGH GMAIL ETC FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES.\nFinally, take pictures of every document received, including receipts for mailing costs associated with sending documents back and forth across country lines. Keep copies of everything electronic and physical regarding the transaction process. And most importantly, write down ALL correspondence, phone calls and conversations. Date stamps matter too. Once again, don't assume that a handshake or smile equates to honesty. Always err on the side of caution when making big decisions involving large sums of money. That goes double for international transactions. Good luck.\nposted by Unicorn on the cob at 5:11 PM on June 28 [7 favorites]\nIsn't this what Craigslist is for?

        "question": "Help me to understand: to whom did J.P. Morgan's $2b in losses go?  I vaguely understand that these losses came after synthetic derivative portfolio positions (an ostensible \"hedge\") went bad. But what does this mean, in simple terms? \nWho is in receipt of that 2 billion now? And should I understand this as another manager or set of managers \"beating\" JPM, or just JPM getting lost in their own complex strategies?",
        "prediction": "  \n(I am a non-finance person and have trouble keeping up with the details.)\n\nComment: @Suresh - it sounds like you are asking two different questions here... 1) Who was responsible for the loss at JPMC; 2) What happened on the CDO market more generally.  The second question has been answered by many other answers already. As far as your first question goes, we don't know who was ultimately responsible within JPMorgan Chase itself because they keep things pretty compartmentalized internally (which isn't unusual). It would be similar if you were an employee working in the sales department where you didn't know who had made the mistake on a particular sale but only knew about the outcome.\n\nAnswer: A CDO is a \\em{collaterised debt obligation} which means there will be lots of individual bonds collated together into one big pile and then sold off as a single unit. These might come from different companies so each bondholder may not care too much whether or not all the others get paid back. However when you buy something called a [synthetic CDO](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), you pay someone else to take responsibility for repaying those loans instead. If some default, you lose money. In return for taking over that risk, you receive interest payments based upon the value of the underlying loan pool. So while buying a regular CDO gives you exposure to risky assets, buying a synthetic CDO makes you exposed to counterparty risk. You could also buy insurance against credit defaults through a CDS (credit default swap).\n\nJ P Morgan bought a lot of synthetic CDOs from Goldman Sachs etc, which turned out to be worthless.\n\nThe problem is that nobody really understood how complicated these instruments were until they started blowing up in everyone\u2019s face during the financial crisis.\n\nThis paper explains quite clearly why they were such a disaster waiting to happen: http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2469/faj.v78.n5.3",

        "answer_2": "J.P. Morgan, along with many other large banks, had made significant bets on continued increases in the sub-prime lending market. While I can't remember their exact exposure to secondary markets (derivatives, etc.), I do know some of their losses came from their investments in sub-prime mortgages and mortgage backed securities.\nWhen loans go into default, banks that hold mortgage-backed securities acquire the underlying properties as collateral. As more and more properties were defaulted on and subsequently listed by the bank attempting to recover their investment, the housing market was flooded and prices dropped. A drop in the value of the collateralizing asset increases the default risk of a loan because the sale of the property would not recover the outstanding debt. The risk of a loan is a key factor in calculating the expected present value of mortgages, and as home prices dropped the present value of the mortgage-backed securities dropped as well. "

You do not ever pay for anything at work unless you are reimbursed, work clothes, business trips, even office equipment.\nCompanies do spend on you because it makes you more productive to work for them and you're a happier employee if you have the tools you need. For example I ordered two high quality monitors for work and a keyboard that is all business-expense for them. But since I'm on the computer all day I warranted the expenses and the days I occasionally work from home I have a monitor there too that work also wrote off.\nIf you have to ask the question if you're being scammed, you know you're being scammed."

You don\u2019t want any financial distraction when you are trying to build wealth.\nIf you are able to save part of those earnings without having too many financial distractions, go ahead. If not, focus on paying off student loans, credit cards, auto loan, personal loan, and other consumer debts. Then, start building an emergency fund. Once you get done with all these things, keep saving and investing.\nYou may also consider moving closer to where you live now if it saves you money. Your current commute sounds like it might cost you over half-an-hour each direction per trip at least five times per week. That could add up to several hundred dollars per year based upon how long you spend driving vs walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation, or even just waiting around at traffic lights. Even if you move into another apartment within the same complex, this alone could easily cover your entire rent increase while leaving plenty left over every month. And since you say you already own a vehicle outright, there wouldn't really be anything else holding you back once you find something affordable nearby. Just be aware that if someone offers free parking near their place because they know people who drive everywhere won't bother looking elsewhere unless forced to due lack of options available locally...they probably aren't offering discounts either. So before signing anything anywhere remember \"the grass isn't always greener\".

Did you know realtor.com and redfin now have additional flood information for each listing called \u201cFlood Factor\u201d (you can also go to floodfactor.com and enter your address).\nThe house is located in Chicago suburb (south west of Chicago with not many flood plains in the area). FEMA zone X (low risk) meaning the house is NOT in a flood pain and does NOT require flood insurance. Optional flood insurance for this property is $700/year.\nHOWEVER, this property has flood factor score of 8/10. Out of 12 houses that backs this retention pond, only two houses have severe to extreme risk. And other two have moderate risk and all the rest scored 1/10.

We did look at the history but didn't find anything about the program. It could be true though....\n@TorontoDreamer - yes, we did check Zillow as well and found out the same thing. So confusing because our real estate agent told us she used Flood Factor when looking up listings too.....\nPosted: 6th Feb 2023 If you want to get into another state then the new law will affect you if you don't already own your home there. But since you live elsewhere, why wouldn't you just move anyway? You won't even need an ETA until May 1st which gives you plenty of time to plan ahead.\nAs far as buying a house near a lake goes, remember that lakes freeze over every winter. Do you feel comfortable having to dig yourself out of a frozen lake sometime around Christmas? That may sound silly, but trust me, it isn't. There were several times last year that my car had snow drifts against it from the wind coming off Lake Michigan. The ice would build up on the roof of the garage door and it would take a few minutes to break through. This happened often enough that we actually installed heating cables underneath the driveway to melt the ice and make getting in easier during the cold months.\nWe are planning to stay in Florida till April-May next year. We might rent somewhere else for summer instead of living in hotels. Then come October-November next year, head north again to spend Thanksgiving weekend and start house hunting afterward.\nIf we end up moving to Illinois, it probably means we\u2019ll spend half of the year in IL and half of the year in TX. Since Texas doesn\u2019t require residents to pay income taxes, we might consider spending most of our days down south :)\nPosted: 6th Feb 2023 @TorontoDreamer - what type of properties do you usually purchase? I am trying to figure out whether or not a house with high flood factor should worry me based on your response below.\n\"But since you live elsewhere, why wouldn't you just move anyway?\"\nDo you mean move permanently OR move temporarily while waiting for the housing market to cool down?\nPosted: 6th Feb 2023 As long as the floods aren't happening every month then I'm ok with it. Some areas are worse than others depending upon where exactly you choose to put your house. For example, right across town from mine used to regularly experience flooded basements due to groundwater seeping into their foundation walls causing them to leak. They eventually built a retaining wall along part of their yard line preventing future problems although nothing prevents further damage if something changes outside such as nearby trees falling onto power lines creating large amounts of rainfall which causes overflows etcetera.\nMy advice would be to either buy somewhere else entirely or wait until prices drop significantly before purchasing anywhere close enough to potentially experiencing major flooding events. At least once per year!\nPosted: 7th Feb 2023 @TorontoDreamer - thank you!!\n\u201cSome areas are worse than others\u201d. Yes, makes sense. Thankfully, the house we are considering is not on the shores of the lake. Instead, its behind a retention ponds and has no direct access to the water. Its safe from annual spring thaw. Also, the neighboring homes are pretty much on flat land without hills or mountains surrounding them. No wonder the flood risk is low compared to other neighborhoods\u2026\nPosted: 7th Feb 2023 @TorontoDreamer - yes, we are considering moving to warmer climate first and later decide between moving back North vs. South. Right now, I personally prefer warm weather states like California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington & Hawaii. My husband prefers East Coast states like Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland & Virginia plus DC. In terms of choosing a permanent residence, we are leaning towards Midwest region such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas & Nebraska.\n",

We don't want to reinvest the money into another IRA or similar investment that might lock up the money for several years in case we need access to the money for health or other emergency expenses. In other words, we want to prioritize at least some liquidity (at minimum, we'd like to be able to make withdrawals 4 times per year) by investing in something low-risk. What would you recommend we do?",
        "prediction": "\nYour situation is one of those rare cases where it makes sense to leave your funds invested in a taxable account rather than rolling them over into an IRA. The main reason: You can tap these assets whenever you wish without paying penalties on early distributions from retirement accounts. So while this strategy won\u2019t earn as much income each year compared to holding the funds in an IRA, there will be no limit on how often you take out cash.\nWithdrawal limits aside, though, it does sound like you could use more help figuring out which type of short-term savings vehicle works best for you. Here are three options worth considering:\nMoney market fund. These mutual funds typically offer modest returns but provide instant liquidity. And since they generally hold only safe securities such as Treasury bills, CDs and commercial paper, they tend not to lose value during periods of volatile markets. Just remember that any interest earned isn\u2019t guaranteed so if rates rise sharply after you open your account, you may find yourself losing ground relative to inflation. Also note that most banks charge fees when balances fall below certain minimums \u2014 say $1,000. But many brokerage firms waive all charges unless your balance falls below zero. That said, you should always check whether a particular bank imposes transaction costs before opening an account; otherwise you risk having to pay hefty penalties every time you dip into your funds.\nUltra-short bond ETFs. Like their long-only counterparts, ultra-short bond exchange traded funds track indexes made up entirely of fixed-income instruments whose duration ranges between six months and two years. As such, they deliver higher yields than traditional money markets while maintaining relatively little exposure to credit risks. Unlike individual stocks however, these portfolios are designed specifically for conservative investors seeking steady income streams instead of capital appreciation. For example, iShares Short Maturity Bond Fund SHY has returned about 3 percent annually over the past decade versus roughly 2 percent achieved through its benchmark index SPDR Barclays Capital Long/Short Government Bond Index BFZ. However, unlike most stock funds, these vehicles aren\u2019t rebalanced regularly meaning that prices fluctuate wildly depending upon changes in supply demand dynamics. Therefore, if you decide to buy shares today expect them to decline significantly within days weeks following your purchase due primarily because someone else sold off his position earlier that same week thereby reducing available inventory levels across multiple exchanges worldwide. This phenomenon known \u201cdead cat\u201d effect occurs frequently among small caps especially when large institutional players exit positions en masse causing dramatic swings downward toward zero.

My question today regards to stop losses...\nLet say I buy shares XYZ @ $10 per share ($10 x 10 = $100), now suppose that tomorrow morning I wake up find myself holding onto this position overnight hoping to close above break even point ($10 + spread cost = $10.90). However, due to news from China we suddenly drop below our entry level to $9 (-$1). So now what happen next? Do we just keep buying back whatever amount needed to bring us back to breakeven point again since our initial purchase price was already covered by our sold portion thus leaving no room left inside margin? Or else once we reach breakeeven point why bother keeping hold onto remaining shares anymore? Is there any rule of thumb guide lines applicable here?

Your email is pretty straightforward - let me try to explain what might occur during a typical day like yours using examples from real life.\nFirst, let me remind readers that although prices fluctuate throughout each day (sometimes wildly!) they tend toward mean reversion meaning that eventually they return towards fair value given enough data points collected over time (which could take weeks or months depending upon volatility levels experienced). Therefore, when setting stops always remember this concept since it helps avoid unnecessary stress caused by fearful emotions such as greediness & panic attacks leading us astray from rational thought processes required for successful decision making under pressure situations encountered daily within our industry.\nSecond, assume you bought 100 shares of XYZ Company at $10 per share totaling $1,000 dollars invested capital plus commissions paid prior entering long side trade position. Now imagine yourself being forced out due unfavorable news headline hitting worldwide markets causing stock price fall sharply resulting current situation similar scenario described earlier whereby purchasing power lost completely due seller offering higher bid asking lower price thereby reducing available funds held cash reserve balance used cover shortfall created excessive leverage employed during original transaction conducted last week ago...\nYou need another 100 shares purchased immediately following announcement hit wires otherwise risk running out funds fast leaving nothing left behind except empty pockets filled emptied wallets containing worthless pieces paper currency representing monetary units denominated dollar sign printed onto various types bank notes issued nation states located across globe including United States Federal Reserve Bank located Washington DC area near Capitol Hill building surrounded green lawn grass landscaping decorating grounds surrounding main entrance doorway entrance hall lobby area providing access visitors tourists seeking knowledge understanding finance economics globalization topics discussed regularly conferences seminar meetings hosted university campuses colleges schools found country wide located regionally scattered locations throughout continents spanning entire planet Earth itself encompassing vast majority surface space inhabitable areas known collectively referred geography term Geography World Map showing boundaries countries divided nations divided states separated provinces territories islands peninsulas",
        "answer_1": "Selling order flow is much misunderstood by retail traders. For the most part, it is a good thing for you as market makers will be willing to be give you a better fill if they know you are retail.\nThey aren't exactly countertrading you, they just want to earn the spread getting it and out. If it's your small retail order, they are probably safe to do that. If it's a large institutional investor that has 1 million more shares they are trying to sell, then not so much.",
        "answer_2": "By allowing the market-makers to have to first peek at your orders, you are essentially volunteering to get negatively selected (i.e. if the MM sees your order and likes the other side, you will get filled). If you trade frequently enough and do some basic transaction cost analysis, you will find that you get picked off more  (i.e. adverse move after the order got filled with a frequency higher than a random fill would assume) and that you miss opportunities more (i.e. orders that did not get filled had a favorable move soon after).  \nIt is common for retail/semi-retail traders to shrug off the implicit transaction costs built into PFOF, but these costs are very real and do add up over time."

        "answer_1": "It all depends on what you want to eat. If you're literally just going for \"food that will keep me alive and able to function well in class,\" you can make $50/week work. If you lift weights or otherwise work out, or are trying to eat a healthy variety of food, you're going to need to spend more. I spend about $125-150/week on food. But I eat about 4000 calories per day, 40/35/25 protein/carb/fat macro breakdown, and eat a variety of different fresh fruits and vegetables in addition to changing up my protein sources (chicken breast/thighs, ground turkey, hamburger, etc). Really depends on what you want to eat.",
        "answer_2": "You're getting a lot of what are truly the 'lowest' reasonable ones.  Your choices will likely also be influenced by meal plan (do you have one?), availability of kitchen (back in my day, we had a hot plate... I think...), and your willingness to cook (= time). \nFor comparison, I (single) spend about $250/mo eating out at work (1.25 meals per day, approximately, 5 days per week, $10 / meal).  Add groceries ($150/mo) for dinner (often sandwiches - not as cheap as cooking, by far) and cereal, add $200 for other going out to restaurants / brunch with friends outside work.  Doesn't include drinks - which are a whole 'other beast.  This is probably on the very high end of reasonable.  Yeah you CAN spend more, but you'd have to try pretty hard.  When I do my 'emergency' planning - what if I lost my job, etc. - food and drink is a place I can save $500 / mo pretty quickly.  You switch to bulk storable plant based food with moderate amounts of veggies and little meat - rice and beans, etc. - and you could probably get sufficient nourishment in your body to survive for a month at a cost of maybe $30 tops.  However, you may go insane."

        "question": "Capital One debacle So, here's my problem PF. I have checking, savings, and CC accounts with Cap. One. My wife, and I have all our bills (except mortgage and car payments) set up to auto pay to a capital one CC that we pay off monthly. I checked my accounts this morning, like every morning, and I noticed that the card I use for the bills was showing a $0 balance (expected since I paid it off 3 days ago), but the available credit was also showing $0. I called Capital One, and they said this was because \"the fraud department placed a hold on the last payment to ensure it clears your bank\". The problem is that Capital One IS my bank, they are also the bank holding 2 of my CC (including the one in question), checking/savings accounts, and 1 auto loan. They put a hold on funds coming from their own bank, and in effect froze my credit card until Monday. Have you guys/gals ever heard of this? Am I wrong for thinking this is absolutely ridiculous? How can I get this resloved? I contacted customer service for the CC, but they said they are unable to do anything because the banking side is closed for the holidays. To say I'm angry would be an understatement. If this doesn't get resolved, I may just pull ALL of my accounts with them and go to a different bank.",

It is possible that there was some fraud or an odd payment.\nYou get it resolved by waiting until the next business day to talk to someone at the bank. Be polite, but firm. You are free to move your money elsewhere, but being mad now is not going to get your account unfrozen any faster. If you need money between now and Monday, I assume you are still able to use your debit card that is connected to your checking/savings account at an ATM.\nAlso, consider stashing some of your emergency fund as cash in your house. Useful for this situation or a weather related emergency where machines might be down.",
        "answer_2": "On top of what everyone mentioned, which is more important BTW, I will say Cap One's service had slipped. I ended up canceling two products with them and told them I'll never do business with them ever again. \nDiscover or Credit Union is the way to go for checking, savings and a credit card. For other credit cards, Chase has the best products, but Citi's 2% card is the simplest money back CC."

Thanks!\nstocks investing stock-valuation price-volatility\n$\\begingroup$ There are some companies whose stock prices have gone negative (or close enough) due to reverse splits: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_split $\\endgroup$ \u2013 Nate Eldredge Jul 3 '15 at 4:36\nThe short answer is no - a company cannot go bankrupt because its share price hits zero. The long answer involves debt and options.\nIf you were holding CFW shares valued at about $200 each ($0.22 x 800), then yes, those would likely be profitable over time even though they're currently traded below their purchase price. But what does \"profitable\" mean here? In the sense of generating returns above inflation? In the sense of earning money on top of the capital invested? These aren't necessarily the same thing. And we don't know how much CFW has paid out in dividends since you purchased them -- which might make a difference. Also keep in mind that buying an asset doesn't guarantee future profitability; it only increases the odds.\nSo let me ask you: why did you buy these shares originally? Did you think they had good prospects, or simply believed that any publicly traded security would probably appreciate eventually, and wanted to take advantage of the low price point? If it's the former, great! Keep hanging onto them. You may end up being right. On the other hand, maybe not. Maybe things won't work out as planned. Then again, perhaps they already haven't worked out according to plan...in which case, consider whether it makes more sense to hold onto assets that aren't doing well rather than reallocating resources elsewhere. It depends entirely upon your risk tolerance and financial goals.\nAs far as what happens after a stock goes to zero, nothing really changes except that you stop owning it. Your brokerage firm may credit whatever remaining balance to your account once all liabilities related to the position have been satisfied. This wouldn't affect the total value of your portfolio unless you used the funds to purchase something else.\nNot the answer you're looking for?

        "question": "can someone please describe the experience of short selling a stock? Hi,\nSo, I just upgraded e*trade to a margin account, and I would like to short a stock when I feel like it will drop. So far I've been doing OK with the \"buy low, sell high\" process, and I've been selling and just waiting when stocks have been dropping recently. I'd like to be shorting and making money, since I'm pretty confident (and have been correct, so far) generally about when things will drop.  \nMaybe it's just me, but it seems scary to short a stock. Theoretically, it's just the opposite of buying long. But it seems like it's more of a gamble. Do you feel this way?  \nSo, what was your first short sell like? Do you have advice, or any \"rules of thumb\", like \"don't spend more than 50% of available cash to short a stock\", \"sell and take your losses if stock rises 20%\", etc.?   \nHow long do you typically hold before selling back? Are there any difficulties I may have? I know that if price goes UP, I'll lose money. But are there any situations where things can get out of hand real quick? I usually check my etrade every 15-30 mins.  \nTHANKS for any advice you may have!  ",
        "prediction": "\n**\u2014Joshua, age unknown  \n _My answer:_ **The only thing worse than being wrong is not knowing whether you were right or wrong. This quote by Nassim Nicholas Taleb applies here. Short sales are great because they allow us to make bets on our opinions without putting ourselves in too much risk. In other words, we can put down $4,000 as collateral ($8k limit plus interest), wait until something happens that makes us think we're going to profit from a move lower in XYZ Company, then buy it back at a loss once the company declares bankruptcy, fires its CEO, or whatever else might happen that causes the share price to fall dramatically. As an example, let's say ABC Inc. has a market cap of $6 billion dollars, which means each share costs $60. You borrow shares through your brokerage firm for $6 per share, pay them the dividend, and now own 100 shares worth $600. Your total investment cost is $600; your potential gain if the stock falls below $60 is $9,940; and your potential loss if the stock rises above $60 is -$70. If you believe that the stock won't rise past $60, you could theoretically keep these shares forever. However, most people don't want to tie up their capital indefinitely. That's why most folks who use leverage set stop orders to liquidate positions automatically if prices hit certain levels. For instance, you might decide that if the stock ever hits $63, you no longer trust your opinion and therefore want to exit the position immediately. By using stops, you're essentially taking insurance against your opinion turning out to be completely incorrect. And even though it sounds simple enough, I recommend reading some books such as Reminiscences of a Stock Operator and Market Wizards to learn how experienced traders approach the markets. Also, read the appendixes in Ed Thorp's Beat the Dealer book to see exactly how he made his fortune counting cards in Las Vegas casinos many years ago. Finally, remember that all those famous hedge fund managers aren't geniuses simply because they're able to figure out when stocks go up. They also know how to manage large amounts of money responsibly, and protect themselves financially when they miss calls.** \u2014Sven Carlin\n#  **Ask Sven #10: How Can One Avoid Being Too Aggressive When Trading Stocks?**\nI am currently in college studying business administration. My goal after graduation is to become a full time trader working from home. I really enjoy learning new concepts regarding finance, economics, politics, psychology, etc., and applying them to my trading strategies. I love the idea of having complete control over my own destiny rather than relying solely on someone else. Since I started investing two years ago, I've had nothing but success thanks to my knowledge base and ability to adapt quickly to changing conditions. Even during the recent downturn, I managed to turn a small sum into almost double due to my strategy. It's very exciting and rewarding, especially considering I'm still young. Now that I understand the mechanisms behind successful trading, I plan to start looking for a mentor/partner so I can continue building upon my skills while expanding my network. Unfortunately, everyone I talk to says the same thing: Be patient and avoid getting greedy. After hearing this multiple times, however, I decided to ask myself if perhaps I wasn't trying hard enough. Could I possibly improve my performance further despite already achieving tremendous results thus far? I began analyzing data again and realized that maybe I actually was being aggressive instead of patient. Maybe it isn't necessary to sit around waiting for perfect opportunities because sometimes they never come. Sometimes good deals appear suddenly and disappear just as fast unless acted upon swiftly. Perhaps by becoming less conservative overall I could achieve better returns with fewer risks taken. With this thought in mind, I asked friends for feedback on whether they felt my strategy needed improvement. Most said yes and advised me to increase exposure gradually over several months instead of jumping straight into deep water. Others told me they didn't notice anything different except slightly higher profits compared to last year. Either way, I found both responses helpful because now I finally know what areas require attention. I appreciate anyone willingness to give honest answers regardless of whether negative criticism hurts feelings temporarily.

If the short moves against you (prices rises), the option loses value, but you will not lose more than your initial investment.

Please help! -_- 45 comments\nGirlfriend wants to break up after we move in together: Help!? Hey guys! Soooo, long story short my boyfriend broke up with his ex last year then he met me. We started talking back in October and everything was going great until Christmas when he told me that he wanted us to live together before we moved away from our hometown where both of our families are. Well now were living together and things aren\u2019t exactly perfect. He doesn\u2019t cook much (which sucks cause im terrible) and hes always busy working and stuff which leaves him home alone alot. Its hard for me too cuz its lonely here sometimes especially if Im by myself and cant reach anyone easily without having to walk downstairs. Things arent bad though\u2026 Just kinda lonely lol. Anyway today we talked about moving back closer to family once summer comes around next year and he said \u201cyeah thats cool\u201d then later asked me if Id rather stay here and he would find another place somewhere else nearer to work. I told him no way I dont think you could handle being apart from your kids everyday and he replied saying \u201cwell thats why ill leave mine behind\u201d. Now im worried that he doesnt actually love me enough to spend time with me and make memories with me instead of spending most nights with his children. Am I crazy? Should I ask him straight up if he loves me enough to spend more than half his life with me? I really need some advice please :(. 60 comments",

Tried posting this in r/technology where most of the Comcast disaster stories are posted, but it was removed. Since this involves being sent to collections, hopefully it will be welcomed here, as I'm just trying to warn Comcast customers about future fiascos that they may encounter. Also because I've been working really hard on improving my credit, so this pisses me off to no end.\nDisconnected my account because I moved to an apartment complex that they don't service. (I now have WOW Cable, thank God.)\nReceived my final bill for $77.60, which says the due date is 10/05/14. Okay! No biggie. At least they didn't cause a whole final bill fiasco, charge me for equipment that I returned, or any of the other terrifying situations that I've read about involving dealing with Comcast and closing accounts.\nI thought all was well too soon I suppose. I get a call a day or two after receiving my final bill in the mail from a collections agency telling me that my account has been turned over to them and they want me to pay my balance right away.\nPoints I try to argue: A) My bill is not due until 10/05/14. B) I JUST GOT MY FINAL STATEMENT OF $77.60 NOT EVEN 2 DAYS AGO! C) My account was disconnected as of 9/14/14! How can I be in collections if it hasn't even been 30 days since the disconnection of my service?\nThe person calling me is from overseas, I try to explain my situation and why my account should not even be her business because it shouldn't be in collections at all. I pay my bills. Every month. On time. By the due date. For over four years I paid the ungodly amounts that they wanted for average speed \"HSI\" and television channels that play the same crap over and over.\nOf course none of this matters to her, because there is such a language barrier. She doesn't understand what I'm saying. I'm wasting my breath. I might as well be talking to a brick wall.\nI hang up and call Comcast directly to find out what's going on. Again, I get someone from overseas who is of no help. How can someone help me if they can't understand what my dilemma is to begin with? I ask for a supervisor, and I'm put on hold for so long that I decide to concede. I hang up, and call the automated system to pay the amount due to bring my account to a zero balance, because I don't want to receive harassing phone calls from this collection agency or be bothered with Comcast at all anymore.\nI just want to forewarn everyone out there that this is the kind of crap Comcast continues to pull.

That said, I would still hope that the people reading this post know their rights and aren't afraid to fight back when necessary. You can always file complaints online through your state website, or go down to the local courthouse yourself. Just do some research first. If you feel strongly enough, then by all means take action. But please remember that you must follow procedures correctly otherwise your case could easily become dismissed without prejudice. There's plenty more people out there willing to take advantage of those who simply give up instead of fighting back.

        "question": "Car isn't working. Don't need one for a while but insurance company says a gap in coverage will result in much higher rates when I need it again. True? I reduced my coverage to the bare minimum, but are they lying to me to keep me paying or is it in my best interest to not have a gap in coverage?",
        "prediction": "\nA: It\u2019s definitely true that if you don\u2019t maintain continuous coverage (in other words, don\u2019t allow your policy to lapse) then your rate can be significantly increased upon renewal of your auto policy. This is called \u201crating\u201d and happens because carriers assume that drivers who let their policies expire without purchasing new ones must pose greater risk than those who do purchase new policies. Insurance companies also believe that these high-risk customers may seek out more expensive premiums from providers willing to take on this type of clientele. So yes\u2014it would behoove any driver who needs an automobile policy at some point down the road to avoid letting his/her current plan end before finding another option first!",

They further notified me that once I reinstated the policy at my previous level of coverage, I would get a refund of about 70% of the discounted premium I paid during those six weeks off.\nDon't know who you're insurance company is, but GEICO is great and has always been easy to work with -- maybe you can see if your insurance company might do something similar?

Many restaurants accept them, and they can add up quickly. He needs to know which ones do and which don't because sometimes the answer isn't obvious. For instance, some places won't accept them while they are open but will during their happy hour timeframe. Others will offer cash back instead.\nIf he has good control over his appetite, he can use these points to eat out quite often, especially since most restaurant meal costs are higher than grocery store meal costs.\nIn addition, he doesn't mention any medical insurance plans or Medicare premiums. These alone can easily exceed half his budget unless he takes advantage of subsidies available under Obamacare. As Brian pointed out, the amount he gets depends upon several variables including age and income level.\nFinally, we really don't know what type of housing situation he expects to pursue nor what types of vehicles he intends to purchase. Someone who rents an efficiency apartment near mass transit options could likely maintain a very modest standard of living for relatively little money.

We signed a contract saying that we would pay him $250 per day plus materials until he finishes the job. He started working last month without telling us when his crew would come each day. One morning at around 7 am one guy came into our kitchen and said \"Good Morning\" while another guy was standing outside holding a ladder. After that, they did nothing except stand around chatting among themselves. At lunchtime they left, never doing anything else during the entire day. The next day the same thing happened again only this time two guys were present. This went on everyday for about three days. On Friday afternoon, the contractors called and told us that they could start working Monday through Saturday starting at 9am sharp! We agreed to meet them at 9am on Monday morning. When we arrived, they were waiting for us dressed in construction gear. Our project manager was very upset that they kept changing their hours and schedules. We discussed what had transpired during the past few days and he stated that the workers were supposed to arrive at 7AM instead of 9 AM. Our PM stated that he wanted to discuss compensation for the inconvenience. The company representative informed him that there wouldn't be any additional charges due to missed appointments. However, later that evening we received a call stating that someone needs payment immediately otherwise they will stop working altogether! So far none of the money requested by either party has ever been given which means that neither side wants to compromise on price. Is there anyway possible under law to hold onto funds owed until completion of the project?

But in other cases \"heavily\" may just refer to the percentage of ownership being relatively large compared with other companies or sectors within the same market segment/industry. In many countries publicly traded corporations must have at least a certain minimum amount of shares held by non-institutional investors. If there were no such requirement then all institutionally controlled entities would end up owning everything! So the existence of restrictions regarding how much can be held by individual shareholders is usually interpreted positively because it suggests that institutional investment isn't unreasonably concentrated into too few hands.\n\nAs for \"over 90%\"... well that doesn't tell us anything useful unless we know something about the industry sector involved. It might indicate that a particular firm has been performing very strongly relative to its peers -- which will tend to attract additional capital from both institutional and retail sources alike; hence why it's growing faster than others. However, there'll also likely still remain plenty of room left available for further expansion without having to raise additional funds via issuing new equity.",

There are many different ways you could be wrong about this. For example, what if we assume that he pays $7k/year into his IRA instead of applying that money towards principal repayment each year? What happens then? It depends on how much debt he had when he started saving vs how much he saves over time. And there are other variables like investment returns etc.\nIt really isn't that simple.

That said, I am also feeling pretty good about where I stand financially. I only hold stocks because I want to build wealth and because I believe in supporting companies whose products/services help improve human life - I couldn't sleep at night knowing that someone I had invested in was making money while harming others. So far, most of the companies I own are doing great work despite being hit hard by COVID. This too shall pass. As I mentioned before, many of us already have cash reserves large enough to cover several months worth of expenses plus emergency fund needs. For myself, I'll use whatever downturn happens due to coronavirus as an opportunity to add to positions further reducing risk overall. A lot depends upon your personal situation though; one man's meat may indeed be another mans poison.\nIn terms of individual stocks, I personally bought into WFC last week near $26 per share thinking that it was oversold given its dividend yield which is around 5%. Its payout ratio is relatively high however so I don't expect it to increase until next quarterly earnings report. I did buy a few shares of MSFT yesterday near $166/share hoping that it holds up better through all of this. IMO, Microsoft is poised to benefit greatly from increased remote working trends thanks to Office365 usage. My largest position remains XOM followed closely behind by BP. Both oil majors were hammered this past Monday but recovered nicely afterwards although both remain underwater YTD. Still, I don't plan on dumping either as energy prices should recover eventually given supply constraints etc.. I also recently added small amounts to CVNA, HLF, and COST among other smaller names. All three appear very attractive based on current valuations especially considering their strong balance sheets and management teams. Finally, I picked up a little bit of FNKO (First National Bankshares) earlier this month primarily because I love bank investing. I've owned First National previously and it performed quite admirably throughout the GFC. While its price action hasn't been nearly as robust thus far, I remain optimistic about its prospects moving forward.\nOverall, I think that there will certainly be winners and losers following Covid-19. However, I firmly believe that owning solid businesses regardless of whether they directly relate to healthcare/pharmaceuticals or otherwise provides protection against market volatility. I find it helpful to remember Warren Buffett's famous quote \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful\".

        "question": "Does it make sense for me to spend all of my savings on college? Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college and to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually not a very good thing?\nMy boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me before I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to <$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I recieved it in the year which would affect my aid.  \nMy feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.\n\u2022 I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.\nI'm a long time lurker here, and after seeing some similar posts recently, I felt inspired to share my situation and talk to the kind people at r/personalfinance who're more financially adept than I am. It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, and emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.\n\nGrants wouldn't save you that much, my boyfriend could be telling me to spend 80k to save >15k over the years right? I've no way of knowing how much to keep before its hurting me, or if I start spending more than I'd save in grants. What do you think the smartest way to use this money is?",

        "answer_1": "You know your boyfriend better than any of us, but this gives me an uneasy feeling. You may lose eligibility for financial aid depending on the school, but the answer to this is not to spend all the money at once. Ideally, you shouldn't have told him about the money, because now he is more likely to try and get it out of you. But the cat is out of the bag. As much as possible, save that money and pretend it's not there (i.e., keep working and saving as you were before). \nIn order to prevent spending all of the money on school, would you be open to considering doing 2 years at a community college? My partner went this route and probably saved about $20k.",
        "answer_2": "I think your boyfriend may have a point, by receiving that money now you may have lost eligibility to financial aid for this year. I think the suggestion to spend some of it to get your eligibility back has some merit, but don't spend it on him and don't spend on anything that you wouldn't have spent originally. That's why he said to prepay your mum's rent.\nI dont know what you can do now, but it may be good to keep looking into how you can get your eligibility for financial aid back starting next year."

        "prediction": "\nsubmitted by /u/fantastic_chicken",
        "answer_1": "As you mentioned owners of Vanguard the company are shareholders of Vanguard funds. With most brokers, they are a publicly traded company owned by shareholders who might use the company as broker or those who don\u2019t with the only relationship with the company being via ownership of the company\u2019s shares. \nFor example, let\u2019s use Charles Schwab. They are publicly traded and have shareholders who each own a percentage of the company like any other publicly traded company. Schwab may offer funds with names like Schwab International or Schwab Tech that are products they offer. You can own any of these funds but that doesn\u2019t equal ownership in Charles Schwab the company, only their funds. Unless you actually own shares of Charles Schwab the company, you\u2019re just treating the company as a company you do business with. For example, I can use Vanguard for everything in my portfolio but also own shares of Charles Schwab the company in my Vanguard portfolio. Thus, I own both companies. If I use Schwab for my whole portfolio but don\u2019t actually hold any shares of Schwab the company then I only own whatever is in my portfolio and nothing for Charles Schwab the company.\nThe advantages of Vanguard being own by their funds/shareholders of these funds is that they don\u2019t have to focus as much on returning money back shareholders like a publicly traded company does. There is no dividend payout or pressure to grow to please shareholders. Instead their funds and the companies within those funds will take care of all that for them. Because they don\u2019t have these responsibilities, they can pass down the cost savings of no dividend payouts or having to spend money to grow to users of the Vanguard platform via low fees/expenses. If Vanguard was publicly traded like Charles Schwab then they\u2019d have to take care of costs of running the company first, then the costs of rewarding the shareholders next before doing anything for the users (not the shareholders of Schwab) of their services last.\nIt\u2019s definitely confusing and complicated and I\u2019m not even sure how big of a difference it makes realistically today but that\u2019s the best I can explain it.",

They certainly won't let you borrow four times your current annual gross income unless you've got a great credit history already established.\n\nThe reason why these calculators spout nonsense like \"$X million dollars\" is because they don't factor in any reality checks against whether or not you could actually get approved for the money.  Even if you could somehow qualify for a loan that large, the interest rate alone would probably cost you far more than the value of the property itself.\n\nIn general, people who use those calculator apps are using them wrong; instead of asking themselves how much they can afford to put toward a new house each year after accounting for their existing obligations, they ask how big a house they can afford given whatever number comes out of the calculator app.  These calculator apps aren't meant to tell you anything useful beyond the fact that you need to make sure you can comfortably cover the bills associated with owning a house before buying one.",

        "prediction": "\nThank you very much!\nSalaam,\nTahir Hussain\"\n# CHAPTER  \n9\n# **How Much Do You Need** _to_   \nSave?\nThe first step toward financial security is knowing how much you need to save each year\u2014and then actually saving enough every month or quarter to reach your goal. Here we answer questions like \"Should I have six months worth of living expenses saved?\" and \"What percentage should go into retirement accounts versus emergency funds?\" We also talk about how much you really need to live comfortably after you stop work. These aren't easy answers; there isn't one magic number everyone needs to shoot for. The best approach is to look at what you earn now, estimate future raises, subtract your current debts, and decide whether you'll ever plan to buy a house or start a family. Then figure out if you're comfortable putting aside anywhere from 5 percent to 20 percent of your gross salary annually for retirement while also building up three-month, six-month, nine-month, and twelve-month cash reserves as well.\nDo I Really Have To Save Money Every Month?\nIf you've been listening carefully, you know that one of our main themes has been the importance of budgeting. And since budgeting requires spending less than you make, having extra money left over after all your regular obligations such as rent, food, clothing, utilities, transportation, medical care, education costs, and entertainment must mean that you're already saving somewhere along the line. But do you really have to set aside money specifically labeled SAVE EVERY MONTH? Or could you simply use that spare change jar sitting around collecting dust beneath your kitchen sink? After all, isn't that technically savings too?\nWe think you should view any amount of money you manage to hold back as savings, even though you may spend those dollars eventually. If $7 goes into that dish instead of being spent elsewhere, that's seven more bucks you didn't blow on junk food or impulse purchases. It doesn't matter whether you designate that candy bar fundraiser profit as savings or just leave it lying around. Either way, that's something you weren't able to access during the week. So yes, you absolutely do need to save money regularly. Even if you're only setting aside fifty cents here and there, it adds up quickly because compound growth works its magic over long periods of time. As you saw earlier, five hundred dollars invested today would grow to almost four thousand dollars in ten years. Now imagine if you had invested five hundred dollars every single year starting right away. In twenty years, that original investment would become nearly eighty thousand dollars. Just by stowing away small amounts consistently, you can build wealth far beyond what you might achieve otherwise.\nBut let's say you feel strongly about saving specific sums every month rather than letting loose change accumulate until it becomes significant enough to throw into an online brokerage account or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to benefit from tax advantages. Well, then you definitely ought to have a systematic strategy in place. One method involves direct deposit into separate bank accounts for different purposes. For example, you might automatically transfer 5 percent of your pretax wages directly to your 401(k); another 5 percent to your Roth IRA; and 5 percent to a special savings account designated solely for vacations, cars, clothes, gadgets, home improvements, college tuition fees, and whatever else strikes your fancy. This setup enables you to avoid using credit cards and borrowing money whenever you come across a purchase opportunity. Instead, you always have these funds available to cover necessary items, which keeps you from going further into debt. Whenever you encounter a new expense category, add it to the list of things you'd like to save for and adjust the existing ratios accordingly.\nAnother option is to create several subaccounts within your primary checking account. Let's assume you receive two paychecks per month. During the first check period, you allocate half your net take-home pay ($685 minus federal, state, Social Security, Medicare, health insurance, and other deductions) to various categories including housing, utilities, groceries, gasoline, car repairs, childcare, student loan payment, charitable contributions, Internet service, cable TV, phone bill, cell phones, magazine subscriptions, dental visits, haircuts, dry cleaning, massages, manicures",
        "answer_1": "I am not familiar specifically with Muslim teachings on interest, but I understand that in most religious sects, interest on loans are forbidden. If you are interested in principles over principal (so to speak), you may take note in the idea that during investment in some things like stocks, you are not obtaining interest as you would on a loan. You are obtaining benefit on a change of price when value is created by owning a piece that company.\nSplitting the line the way I described it... Items that change price are stocks, commodities, and currencies. Items that involve interest on loans are deposit accounts, CDs, and bonds.\nI apologize, again, if this does not match the definition for your religion. I am not terribly familiar with the sin of usury in other cultures.",

My goal at the beginning of last summer was to earn an additional $26,397 before June 4th, which meant saving every extra penny possible from then until today. Since I had already saved up around half of it ($13K) by March of last year, I figured there wasn\u2019t much risk involved as long as I continued working hard and stay disciplined with my spending habits. Well, here we go: Total savings = $28,957!! That brings us down to $1,000 away from reaching our original goal amount of $50k. Here\u2019s some details: Income earned: $10,500 Expenses paid out: $14,450 Net income: +$6,050 Investments made: $22,507 Saving rate during this period: ~85% Now, let\u2019s compare numbers between the first two challenges over the past couple months: First challenge \u2013 February-March \u201917 Second challenge \u2013 April-May \u201917 Third challenge \u2013 May-June \u201917 Saved: $13,396 $13,197 $28,957 Average monthly savings: $10,995 $10,798 $21,596 Months needed to reach target: 13 10 7 Average net income per month: $8,264 $7,112 $14,373 Average expense ratio: 62.8% 59.3% 55.6% Average total invested per month: $4,743 $4,481 $9,221 This third challenge brought more success than both previous ones combined because I focused heavily on increasing my overall cash flow while also reducing expenditures wherever possible. As mentioned previously, I managed to increase my salary significantly so that helped quite a bit but even without doing anything else, the difference in savings rates between this third challenge vs. second one were drastic.

        "question": "I got some unexpected advice from my parents today - they told me to consider raising my budget for rent.  Are they right - am I being too frugal / unrealistic? Recent college grad here who's starting a new job next week.  I'm subletting an apartment for the summer from a friend (got a great deal for an amazing place), but now I'm looking for an apartment to lease starting in August.  I work outside Atlanta in a city called Alpharetta, so there are a ton of options in the area, both in terms of price and in terms of location.\nI've been fortunate in that my parents have covered my rent while I'm in college, but this has now left me in a position where I'm a little unsure of what I should be paying for rent.  My plan was to live frugally over the next few years so that I could quickly pay off a $26,000 loan I owe my parents for my last year of college.  I made this plan with the understanding that it would likely necessitate a drop in living standard from what I've had while my parents were supporting me.\nI was aiming to spend about $600 a month on rent + $100 a month on utilities.  Here is my full budget (I made what I thought were conservative estimates, so some of the categories may be a little high):\nIncome\n\n$2300 (monthly after-tax)\n\nExpenses\n\n$600 Rent\n$100 Utilities\n$200 Groceries\n$50 Restaurants\n$200 Auto Insurance\n$20 Highway Toll\n$200 Gas\n$215 Loan Payment\n$50 Entertainment\n$30 Haircut\n$25 Miscellaneous\n$8 Hulu Plus\n\nLeft Over\n\n$602\n\nBasically my plan was to take that extra $602 a month an throw it at my loan so that I could be done with it as soon as possible.  I talked to my parents today though, and they said that I shouldn't constrict myself too much - that if I was able to find a better apartment in a better location I should consider spending an extra hundred or two a month; that I shouldn't kill myself to be too frugal.  Keep in mind that my parents are the epitome of frugal - they have literally no debt, pay cash for their cars, coupon, etc.\nNow I will admit that there is a big difference between a $600 a month apartment in Atlanta and an $800 a month apartment.  For $800 I could live in a gated community with a pool and tennis courts in a good location like the Virginia Highlands or Buckhead.  For $600 a month I'm going to have to look for something less fancy, in a less desirable and potentially less safe location.\nI was willing to make a little bit of a sacrifice in terms of my living accommodations in order to get my financial house in order, but now my parents have thrown me for a loop.

        "question": "Update: I\u2019ve had 6 offers and still can\u2019t sell my house Thank you everyone for all the advice.  I asked my realtor if we could add a time is of the essence clause, up the deposit and add a bonus to the agent who brought A buyer.  She said no to all three. I had originally stuck with this agent because my fianc\u00e9 insisted on using her. He\u2019s pretty mad that I\u2019ve cut ties with her and that\u2019s a new dynamic that I don\u2019t quite understand.\nI got a final offer on my house that was really low, so low that I was only going to break even on it.  I accepted and the buyers backed out 5 days later and the reason they gave was that they couldn\u2019t afford the payment. Because buyers in California have 17 days to back out I don\u2019t receive any earnest money.  I\u2019ve taken my house off the market and severed ties with my agent.\nIt\u2019s been almost three months since I\u2019ve put my house on the market. A house similar size as mine but without an updated kitchen (it has a white porcelain counter and I have granite) was just listed 40k higher than mine and after talking to the buyer they\u2019ve received a nearly full price offer. I\u2019m thinking my house probably looks like something is wrong with it due to it being on the market so long.   I guess I\u2019ll hold on to it for another year or so and try again. \nThanks for reading this novel and for all the advice :)\nOriginal post:\nSo as stated, I can\u2019t sell my house.  The house was built in 2011. I bought it dec 2014 for 255k.  I am in the Central Valley of California.  My house is part of a planned community that was half built when I bought my house.  The houses built after I bought my house are roughly 1000 square foot larger and cost about 100k more.  The house has granite, wood floors, new carpet (2017) and has been painted with a fresh coat of paint.  It is in a gated complex with access to a pool, water park and playground.\nI am getting married in 26 days and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they\u2019ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.\nThis past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I\u2019m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.\nWe are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it\u2019s not a great option with this house.\nDoes anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?\nThank you so much for reading this!",

If you're a homeowner, you can calculate your mortgage:income ratio (sometimes called a front-end ratio) by dividing your monthly mortgage costs (usually including associated costs like homeowner's insurance, property tax and mortgage insurance) by your pretax monthly salary.\nFor example, if you earn $10,000 per month ($120,000 per year salary) and you pay $2,000 per month in mortgage costs and related fees, your mortgage:income ratio is 0.20.\n0.20 = 2,000 / 10,000\n\nLenders recommend that this number not go above 0.28, but we at Personal Finance know that this number should be as low as you can make it while meeting your housing requirements.

Alright, with that out of the way, :rubs hands together: here we go. \nMy husband worked for a big corporation in for a couple of years.

Don't try to beat the markets -- just buy a fund that tracks an index. Index funds tend to produce returns close to the actual stock market performance over the long run. And 1% dividend yields aren't bad either. As far as the \"stable\" part goes, well, yes, but keep in mind that even a safe asset class tends to experience significant declines once in a blue moon. For example, bonds lost half their value between 2007-2009. Currency values also change dramatically from day to day.\nIn short, nothing is perfectly stable except cash. Even gold isn't completely immune to volatility.

        "question": "Girlfriend cancelled gym membership 2 months ago in the UK, and now she's in the US and they're continuing to charge her Basically title. My girlfriend goes to school in London and was taking the year off and moved back to the United States, so she cancelled her gym membership there. That in itself was a hassle, but they told her it was cancelled and so we thought the headache was done.\nWhen she initially signed up, she used her credit card to pay the initial payment, but then she gave her UK bank account for the monthly billing. When she cancelled, she transfered the money out of her account so it's empty. Tonight, she got a credit card charge from the gym saying she needs to pay for the past 2 months since they couldn't bill her bank account.\nShe's had problems in the past with disputing these charges with her credit card company, so I'm asking if there's anything else we can do? We can't really afford these payments right now and it's just so predatory and disgusting that it continues to be a pain in the ass. Any help or info is appreciated.",

        "question": "People who have retired early, how do you experience the passing of time? I've always wondered if time seems to pass more quickly as we age because our lives turn into a routine, where it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish one day from the next. I'm guessing that this may change for people who retire early, who lead very varied lifestyles. \nObviously the alternate theory is that each year ends up being a smaller percentage of our life as we grow older. I get the feeling it might be a little of both, but I'm curious about what your answers are. \nDo you still feel like time passes much more quickly as you get older? Does it seem to be the same or slower as when you were working full-time?",
        "prediction": " If so, why do you think that is? Do you feel differently than other people in their sixties and seventies (and beyond)\u2014like maybe they don't notice time passing at all anymore? Or does everyone just perceive things differently regardless of whether they work outside the home or not? How has your perception changed over the years since leaving work behind? Have there been any surprises along these lines? Any big changes that surprised even yourself after quitting work? And finally: What advice would give someone considering an earlier exit strategy on how best to approach planning ahead financially for such an eventuality? Thanks again! It was great hearing back from y'all last week; keep those questions coming! We're going live with another episode tomorrow morning at 9am PST / noon ET here: http://www.youtube.com/user/FIREstarterAcadmey\n# Early Retirement Q&A #15 - Talking About Our New Book & More | The Fire Starter Sessions Podcast Ep.204 \nWelcome to today\u2019s video, guys! In case you missed it yesterday, we released our new book called \"The Millionaire Next Door\" which is available now wherever books are sold. Today we thought we could talk a bit about the book itself and answer some related questions regarding FIRE and the book. So let me go through them real quick before jumping right into answering them. First off though, thanks to everybody who tuned in yesterday to watch us record this podcast live via YouTube. We had around 867 viewers join us live and that was pretty exciting seeing so many people tune in together at once. Afterwards we got several comments asking us to release the audio version later on iTunes, Spotify etc., so hopefully we will find a way to make that happen sometime soon too. Alright then, let's start by talking about the book first... ___ \u201cI can tell you that most millionaires are actually quite ordinary looking\u201d \u2013 JL Collins ___ For those of you who haven\u2019t heard yet, my wife Katie and myself wrote a new book titled 'The Millionaire Next Door'. This book explores the myth surrounding wealth creation and shows readers exactly how anyone can become rich without having millions saved away already today. But before getting started, please note that while we'll try our hardest not spoil anything within its pages for you, unfortunately due to legal reasons certain topics cannot be discussed freely online until after publication date. However rest assured knowing everything shared here will remain applicable long afterward \u2014 especially given its timeless nature :) Now onto discussing why writing something like this became necessary\u2026 ___ Aside from wanting folks everywhere realize that becoming rich isn't necessarily tied solely towards money accumulation alone (i.e.: investments), we also felt compelled write down some key concepts found throughout history relating specifically toward building personal fortunes during difficult times like present ones today. By doing so we hope others learn valuable lessons needed moving forward despite whatever obstacles arise along their journey towards achieving financial freedom sooner rather later down road\u2026\n### Question One ### What inspired you two to create \u2018The Millionaire Next Door\u2019? Well originally we didn\u2019t plan on ever creating another book ourselves -- we wanted instead focus strictly upon helping others achieve similar results via blogging platform alone (which worked out well enough). That said however eventually realized publishing something written entirely independently offered unique advantages compared traditional route involving publisher(s)/agent(s); namely complete control over content/style plus ability directly connect w/readership unlike prior efforts allowed previously only indirect contact thru social media channels etcetera.. Once decided move forward however faced challenge finding topic appropriate cover story given limited space left unused thus far among existing material collected over course past few months researching subject matter thoroughly detailed above under heading \u2018Why Write Another Book?\u201d Ultimately chose use concept described therein basis which ultimately led development final draft manuscript currently circulated public domain currently awaiting official launch date announced shortly afterwards following announcement date set forth below paragraph text reads follows\u2026 ### Question Two #### Who Should Read Your Latest Release?

        "answer_1": "The only thing you absolutely are not paying is the loan origination fees.  That might save you somewhere around 1% of the value of the house but probably less than that.  You're probably still paying for the appraisal, inspection, survey, deed fees, agent/lawyer/whatever fees, etc.  \nNow, since you don't have a bank requiring you to do all those, you might be able to save some money by not doing an inspection.  Hopefully you see how something like that is stupid.",
        "answer_2": "There are a few different categories of fees that are included in the closing costs.\nYou will avoid any of the fees you would pay to the mortgage company-loan fees, processing fees, etc.\nYou will also avoid pre-loading an escrow account since you will be paying property taxes out of pocket.\nYou will still pay 1% of the cost of the home in deed transfer taxes to the county.\nYou will pay the closing company fees that process the deed transfer etc.\nYou won't need to have home insurance, structural inspections or pest inspections since there is no mortgage, but you may want to pay for those anyway."

Hi all,\nOver the last year my father has gotten sick, put on permanent SS disability , and with no other income or savings besides that. My mother does not work. I live with my parents and my younger brother who is still in college. He is 23. We also live in NJ is that makes a difference \nNow for the details:\nMy fathers SS pays \\~ $2000 monthly which does not even cover the house mortgage. Thats all the income my parents have.

        "question": "Confused about ETFs I started looking more into ETFs and I'm finding that the performance is just horrible for some of them. That's why I figure I'm doing something wrong in terms of interpreting it. Taking a look at [VEU](  for example, I see the value was higher in 2007 than it is even now. There's no reason to thrown money in there, when there hasn't been an increase over a 10 year period, but is this actually the case? Do ETFs pay dividends as well or something else that can give you gains? Thanks!",
        "prediction": "\n\\$\\begingroup\\$ @LucasKauffman - It does not matter what the price did back then, if you buy today (or sell) your return will be based on current prices. \\$\\endgroup\\$ \u2013 Chris Cirefice Nov 3 '14 at 8:56\nThe market cap weighted index fund has two major flaws which make its use untenable by most investors seeking long term returns; firstly, they do not reflect real world conditions because of their static nature and secondly, they are heavily influenced by short-term traders who want to time markets instead of holding positions for years/decades like Warren Buffet would advocate.\nLet me explain how these two factors work against us using VEU. As mentioned above, we know from history that emerging countries have outperformed developed ones since the turn of century. The problem with a passive strategy such as tracking indexes though is that it cannot change course without changing the entire portfolio. So while one could argue that the US stock market is currently undervalued compared to say Europe etc., he still needs to own both equally. This means that he is forced to hold onto his position despite knowing full well that the situation may reverse itself any day. In other words, buying low and selling high is impossible. And this makes sense given that all active managers face exactly the same issue. Even hedge funds are limited by their mandates, so they too cannot deviate from a certain path unless their clients allow them to take risks beyond those limits. Thus, there exists a fundamental flaw within all traditional strategies including index funds.\nOn top of this comes another factor called momentum whereby people start chasing winners and avoid losers thereby driving up valuations further until eventually things come crashing down once again leaving everyone feeling foolish for having bought during peak times only to later regret being greedy. These types of events happen repeatedly throughout history causing huge swings between bull & bear phases followed closely behind by periods where nothing happens except maybe inflationary pressures building slowly but surely leading ultimately towards deflationary depressions.

        "question": "Why invest in the S&P 500? Hi. I\u2019m 18 and relatively new to investing in the stock market (started in November). I initially put in ~$430 to my Robinhood account, which I\u2019ve grown to ~$500 based on what I\u2019ve learned through reading articles/books and watching a lot of YouTube. Since I\u2019ve begun, I\u2019ve only invested in \u201cbig name\u201d stocks (CGC, AAPL, TSLA, etc). \nEverywhere I look, I always see how the S&P 500 has succeeded immensely in the last 20 years, with most traders being unable to beat it. A lot of people continue to say that the S&P is the safest bet with regards to long term investing. I have about 3k saved up and was considering putting 1.5-2k in ETFs like SPY or VOO while keeping the $500 I already have in Robinhood to play around with other actual stocks. I guess this leads me to my questions:\nWould it be smart to throw such a large portion of my money into S&P 500 ETFs?\nWhy is there so much hype surrounding it?\nAre there any bear cases for it?\nI realize I can find a lot of this info online, but I want to see a lot of individual takes on this since I\u2019m just getting into the game. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated",
        "prediction": "! Thanks guys.",
        "answer_1": "Because if you buy stocks on your own, the high liklihood is that you may do well initially, but eventually you'll get in something that doesn't do well and you'll not want to sell because then you'd be \"losing money\".  Over time, this causes your returns to be much lower, and more stressful, than simply putting the money into an S&P 500 fund and forgetting about it.",
        "answer_2": "This year's winners are next years losers and last year's losers are this year's winners. Unless you are doing deep qualitative value analysis on your investments you really don't want to just guess. An index gives you a stake in everything at once, which is far safer over time."

        "question": "High Yield Dividends Can anyone offer some advice about high yield dividend stocks.  Is there anything specific I should look for when investing in these types of stock.",
        "prediction": "  Thanks\nAnswer: The first thing to remember is that the term \"high-yield\" means different things depending on who you talk to and what they're trying to sell you! You can get a higher yield from an equity than from, say, bonds or T-bills because it has more risk - but not necessarily more return. There are several ways to analyze this question so let me give them all at once rather than one after another.\n1) How do you define high? This is the most important question since if you don't know where you want to go then any road will take you there. A quick search online shows yields as low as 0% (yes zero!) up to around 35%. So how much above average does your definition have to be before we call something 'high?' If you need 2%, then maybe 4% would qualify; but with today's interest rates, even 7% might not be enough. It really depends upon what type of portfolio you already own. For example, someone who invests primarily in large cap growth companies may find themselves quite happy with just over 6%; whereas someone else looking for income could easily settle for less than half that amount without feeling too deprived by comparison against other options available elsewhere within their existing holdings..\nThe second factor involves knowing exactly why certain securities pay out higher amounts relative others--and whether those factors affect only part of each security issuer's total business operations or apply across every aspect including future earnings projections based off current market conditions alone.* These issues become especially critical given recent economic developments such as increasing inflationary pressures resulting from excessive government spending combined alongside rising unemployment figures due largely towards falling consumer confidence levels caused mainly through weakening housing markets coupled along side tightened lending standards imposed onto borrowers seeking loans under new regulations put forth recently enacted legislatively known collectively simply referred simply referred generally simply called \"Dodd Frank Act\".* Yet despite having been passed almost two years ago now still remains controversial topic among both sides political spectrum alike leading many analysts believe strongly believe strongly feel very confidently convinced completely sure absolutely positive highly optimistic extremely hopeful pretty darn excited very enthusiastic incredibly delighted super duper thrilled amazingly grateful thankfully appreciative deeply grateful profoundly humbled truly honored sincerely blessed exceedingly fortunate tremendously lucky immensely privileged et cetera ad infinitum...etc., etc., ad nauseam...ad absurdum....ad libitum.....ad finem!!!** *********** *** *** ** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***",
        "answer_1": "Look at earnings.  If dividends are too high and earnings too low, you gotta figure that the company is enticing you to buy the stock based on dividend yield and to ignore the fundamentals of the company.",

I was in debt and decided to pick up a second job until I got out in the middle of last year. Both of my jobs are serving/bartending so I make a really good money and was able to pay off my debt within a couple months of really cracking down. Well, two jobs left me with no extra time to spend money and the drive I had to save just stuck. Even when I didn't need both jobs anymore, I couldn't quit one. I put in my two weeks and I was devastated over it and my boss could tell (small family owned place and we're all good friends) so he didn't even bother trying to replace me because he could tell I would change my mind. \nI just got back from a 5 day trip and I'm realizing maybe I have a problem.

The friend I went with keeps posting picture and texting me about the trip and I'm getting frustrated. Everyone keeps asking me how the trip was and I don't even want to talk about it. I can't help but think of the money that was lost instead of the fun things we did. \nI can't help but feel really sad about it.

        "question": "My wife will receive a generous defined-benefits pension. How should this affect our savings habits? To hell with our IRAs? My wife is an assistant principal of public high school in Brooklyn and makes about $100k. At 31, she's been with the Dept. of Ed. for 9 years, and if she retires at about 60 (38 years service time), she'll have a little more then 70% of her salary paid out to her until she dies. Let me say outright how bloody fortunate we are. Well aware, and humbled.\nI make in the neighborhood of $30k as your friendly neighborhood security guard, and together we have about $7k a month in take-home pay (after 10% goes to our retirement plans), of which about $4k is gobbled by fixed and semi-fixed expenses, notably a $2200 mortgage with $620/mo maintenance fee (it's Brooklyn.) That leaves $3k. (We also have a 1 year old child.)\nEverything I've read on this lovely, lovely sub stresses heavy retirement savings, which has been enlightening. But it seems like we'll be well set for retirement, especially when our mortgage is paid off when we're both 61 (hopefully.) So I'm kind of not sure what to do with my savings.\nWe have the kid, so I wonder if I should forego IRA contributions and instead plow the money into a 529? Other things I've thought of doing are paying off our modest car loan and our modest student loans, or maybe even throwing money at our mortgage to pay down the principal (4.5% interest)? Then I've also thought: \"You're being dumb, you should still put in an IRA. Maybe a Roth IRA so you can pull from it.\"\nThen there's investing. I'm a rank amateur in this field and will do more research. But I'd be interested in building up -- maybe in lieu of those IRAs -- a semi-liquid \"Big Ticket Fund,\" to spend on things like vacations, home renovations, kids' camps and travel teams, etc. I'd like this to be accessible, obviously, but it seems like I could build it big enough that part of the money could be out there doing work. Index funds? Or maybe this should be the Roth IRA?\nA few last things. 1. I definitely realize nothing is a sure thing, though I would be very surprised if my wife lost her job. She's tenured, and very good at it. I guess it would be more likely she'd decide on other employment, but this seems very unlikely too. And I'd be thunderstruck if we ever divorced. We're extremely solid 7 years in. 2. I am not sure, on the other hand, if her pension could be legally pared down in the future. I would of course be interested in information here. 3. I plan on insuring both our lives but haven't gotten there quick yet. All of this is a process -- thanks PF! 4. I believe in generally living modestly instead of precise budgeting, so though I understand where you're coming from if you think it's folly, I don't want my \"big ticket fund\" weighted toward particular goals. I have a small kid, might have another, and truly don't know what to expect out of life.\nMany thanks for your help, peeps.

You already seem pretty financially responsible, so keep it up!\nposted by capricorn at 6:36 AM on February 18 [3 favorites]\nSo let me get this straight - you have a $100K+ annual salary plus a guaranteed lifetime payout of >$2M upon retiring @ age ~60. Your biggest concern right now is deciding between contributing to traditional vs roth accounts?\nAnd since you say you have no debts besides a mortgage payment, I assume you mean to ask us to recommend strategies to reduce your mortgage balance ASAP, correct? Because that sounds like something you could figure out without any input from us :)\nIf you really wanted advice regarding spending, why didn't you just start with a description of your current lifestyle + your desired long term lifestyle?\nFor example, if you tell us you currently live frugal and enjoy the occasional vacation, but desire to eventually move closer to NYC and buy a house, then we could offer suggestions based on that scenario rather than trying to come up with a general recommendation applicable across all possible scenarios.\nAnyway, I'm guessing that the best use of your money right now is reducing your mortgage balance faster via extra principle payments. A 529 isn't going to hurt, but it won't speed up repayment either.\n(BTW, I was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Queens, went to CUNY, worked as a teacher before becoming a lawyer, and retired early because I had saved far too much to continue working!)\nposted by rdr at 6:52 AM on February 18 [1 favorite]\nResponse by poster: Hi Capricorn, thank you kindly for responding.

In fact, I hope we do. As such, I suppose the question becomes less about financial prudence per se, and more about setting ourselves up for success in a world that changes constantly. What do people do these days?\nHi RDR, many thanks for taking the trouble to write back. It does sound strange asking about my priorities given the context, but I've learned over time that often times a person doesn't quite see themselves clearly through others eyes, however sympathetic they try to be. This has certainly proven true for myself, and perhaps for some reason I figured I needed some outside perspective. On the subject of mortgages, yeah, I've always planned on making additional principle payments once I could afford them. For whatever reasons, I never did. Now I intend to rectify this.\nThanks again guys. Greatly appreciated.\nposted by mrgrimm at 7:12 AM on February 18\nIt looks like you are already maxing out your tax advantaged options.\nContributing more towards your non-tax deferred retirement account will increase your contribution limits each year due to inflation increases. Withdrawals from a Traditional IRA aren't taxable until later in life. They are fully taxable when distributed during retirement. When you withdraw from a Roth IRA you avoid paying taxes entirely. Additionally, distributions from a Roth are not required until death, unlike the Traditional option.\nWhile the decision to contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depends on your individual circumstances, you may find yourself wanting access to the money sooner than expected. Consider a 529 Plan if you wish to provide educational support to family members.\nposted by wnissen at 7:32 AM on February 18 [1 favorite]\nThere's no problem with using your \"Big Tickets\" fund for vacations, baby sitters, and stuff like that.

        "question": "When would I buy a mutual fund vs. the equivalent ETF? Is one almost always better than the other? I'm looking to start investing and am confused on if I should be doing ETFs or just open an account with a mutual fund.  Guidance would be appreciated!",
        "prediction": "\n\nAnswer: In general, it depends on what you are trying to achieve by buying these funds/ETFs. If your goal is for diversification across different asset classes (i.e., stocks, bonds), then there isn't much difference between buying individual funds versus bundling them into an index-based ETF. However, some people may prefer to have exposure to certain types of securities that aren't available in an index-based product--for example, small cap value stocks, emerging market debt instruments, etc.--in which case they might choose to go beyond those offered through an exchange traded product and instead purchase individual shares directly from the underlying company(ies).",
        "answer_1": "One disadvantage of ETFs is that you can only buy whole shares. If you have $1000 to invest and you're buying shares that cost $101 you'll buy 9 shares and have $91 left over. A mutual fund with the same share price would allow you to buy 9.901 shares.\nETFs generally have a lower expense ratio and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at a variable price whereas traditional mutual funds have a single updated price at the end of every day (NAV = net asset value).\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages so it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish and which financial institution you're working with.",
        "answer_2": "You've gotten good advice here.  I'll just add that it may also depend on how much you have to invest and when.  \nIf you can invest $500/month minimum, then ETFs are probably fine.  You can generally buy a number of shares that is roughly equivalent to that amount.  Obviously, the more you invest monthly the easier it is to get close to an exact amount, but it will always be off by a little.  For a long time, I did a combo of VTI, VXUS and BND that I could get to pretty close to $1000/month when that was my investment budget.\nOn the other hand, if you just want to do a set amount each month without worrying about it, you can do the mutual funds with fixed amounts very easily."

Shouldn't I report those funds on Schedule E of Form 1040? And shouldn't they be taxable income because I paid off my debts instead of using them for personal expenses? Please advise. Thank you very much for all the good advice over these many years. It's been helpful beyond words. Best regards.\nJim\n**Dear Jim:** There's nothing wrong with borrowing against your equity in order to buy other investment properties. In fact, Uncle Sam encouraged you to do just that when he gave you an exclusion of $250,000 ($500,000 if married) on each transaction under the provisions of section 121(a)(b), which says \"You don't recognize gain or loss upon the sale or exchange of your principal residence.\" However, like most things involving the federal government, the devil lies in the details. Specifically, there are two requirements you must meet: First, you must own and use the house as a _primary_ residence for two out of five years prior to its sale, and second, you cannot receive gross profit greater than $250,000/$500,000 unless certain exceptions apply. But let us focus on the former requirement here, which is the one relevant to your question.\nThe key point regarding the two-year ownership test is that you must actually occupy the home as a _principal_ residence within that time period. For example, suppose you purchased a vacant parcel of land intending to build your dream home sometime later. Then you took out a construction loan to finance the building process. Afterwards, you completed the project and moved into the finished product, thus satisfying the two-out-of-five-year residency rule. According to the IRS, however, you could never claim the home as your principle residence simply because you lived in it while constructing the home. Instead, you would have to wait until the date you physically occupied the structure as your main abode.\nTo summarize, you don't need to worry too much about how you spend the proceeds of your home equity line of credit as long as you satisfy the two-out-of-five year requirement. Just remember, though, that you must actually occupy the home as a _principle_ residence throughout the entire two-year span. In addition, please note that only half of the total amount received counts toward meeting the maximum exemption limit. Finally, although the rules governing the capital gains treatment of homes differ depending on whether they serve as the owner's principal residence or rental property, generally speaking, you won't owe any tax whatsoever provided that your annual profits fall below the specified threshold amounts listed above. As always, consult with qualified professionals before making decisions based solely upon information found online or elsewhere outside professional circles.\n---   \n **Ronald M.

While I am happy working as an engineer, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having enough passive income to live off of without working anymore if possible.\nI\u2019d love to hear some tips/strategies from anyone who has achieved FI while still young(ish) so they don\u2019t need to work past their desired age. I will also include a link below where I wrote up how we did it over the years. Thanks again for reading and thanks for being part of Bogleheads! Cheers, -Nick\n\n### Answer #1: Financial Independence Calculator\nHello Nick, congrats on achieving FIRE!! There isn\u2019t much information available online regarding how people achieve FIRE at younger ages, especially those under 30. However, there are plenty of calculators that estimate your future savings based on your current situation, which may give you insight into whether you are on track to reach FIRE by certain milestones.\nHere is a list of tools that can assist you in calculating different scenarios related to FIRE:\n<a href=\"https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Financial_Independence\" target=\"blank\">Bogleheads Wiki</a> \u2013 <u><strong>Financial Independence</strong></u>: This page contains several spreadsheets and calculators that you can use to determine various aspects of FIRE. For example, the <u><strong>Four Percent Rule Spreadsheet</strong></u>, estimates the number of years until reaching FIRE using the four percent rule. The spreadsheet takes into account inflation, taxes, investment returns, salary increases, etc., and provides results for both US and international markets. Another useful tool is the <u><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate Calculator</strong></u>. It allows users to enter parameters including the starting balance, asset allocation, annual expenses, expected return, risk tolerance level, inflation rate, withdrawals per year, and frequency of rebalancing. Based on these inputs, the calculator determines safe withdrawal amounts each year and shows the remaining portfolio value after a set period of time. Additionally, the <u><strong>Investor Portfolios Toolbox</strong></u> offers several helpful resources such as Monte Carlo simulations and real estate calculators. Finally, check out the <u><strong>Retire Early Calculator</strong></u> provided by RetiredAtAge40 forum member \u201cLynn\u201d.\n[https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/welcome-to-the-forums/how-long-until-financial-freedom-(calculations/)](https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/welcome-to-the-forums/how-long-until-financial-freedom-%28calculations%29/). Mr Money Mustache Forum \u2013 <u><strong>How Long Until Financial Freedom (Calculations?)</strong></u>: Here is another thread discussing the topic of FIRE. In particular, user \u201cMr. Money\u201d posted his calculations and analysis in great detail. His post includes formulas and graphs showing how he arrived at the conclusion that he needed $1 million saved to achieve financial freedom at age 35. Users responded with suggestions for ways to reduce spending even further, leading him to increase his savings goal by half a million dollars. Overall, this thread serves as an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn more about financial planning strategies related to FIRE.\nPersonally speaking, I believe that achieving FIRE requires careful consideration not only of monetary factors but also lifestyle choices. Some questions worth asking yourself might include: Do you want children? Are you willing to accept less compensation now in exchange for greater earning potential later? Would you rather travel than buy material possessions? These considerations must factor heavily into deciding whether pursuing FIRE makes sense given individual circumstances; however, once made aware of its existence, no one should ever feel pressured toward either direction regardless of age bracket due solely upon external influences alone. Lastly remember always strive towards living within means rather than above them\u2013this way success becomes easier",

(Details inside) We are considering buying a house and looking for advice if it makes financial sense. I work for a government agency and currently putting in for location transfer when they solicit every 6 months. Now the likelihood of my transfer getting approved probably won't happen for the next 2-5 years, but I continue to request the transfer to help my chances down the road when its actually realistic. \nThe housing market in my area is doing well and the prices are really good for brand new builds.

My desired transfer location would be in the same state which makes managing a rental a little easier. \nAlso when my agency approves a move they give you a lump sum of money depending on if you rent or own to help in the moving costs.

        "answer_1": "As a rule of thumb, your monthly rent should be about 1% of your purchase price in order to cover all of your expenses and make decent cash flow.  So like if you buy a house for $300k you should be able to rent it out for $3000/mo.\nHowever I think that you will find that in areas with a strong housing market you'll get something like 50-60% of that, i.e. $1500-1700/mo.  If you run the numbers and include all costs, property tax, insurance, vacancy, marketing expenses, repair and upkeep, you'll probably be basically breaking even on a cash flow basis.  So the only way you will make money is through appreciation and paying down your mortgage.  You will make a little bit this way but if you consider your down payment tied up in the house it might not be a very good return on investment.  It would all depend on the appreciation.\nManaging a rental property when you don't live in the area is difficult because you can't go see the property and have to depend 100% on people that you hire to go out there.  If you hire a company to take care of everything, expect to pay about 8-10% of the rent to them as a fee.  This further cuts into your cash flows and if the company doesn't do a great job it can lead to additional expenses.\nOverall I'd take a very realistic look at the numbers and make sure it is worthwhile.  I would be surprised if it is. Source: I've been a landlord for 25 years.",

If we had not taken loans then there would have been no need to save up that money for our tuition costs. We could simply use any excess cash flow after all living expenses were met to make extra principal payments instead. But since we did take these loans, now those funds must come from somewhere\u2026 hence they should go toward reducing their balances rather than adding onto them with interest.\nIf one is using a traditional FIRE strategy whereby one is trying to build wealth via investment returns while simultaneously increasing one\u2019s net worth through additional contributions/principal reductions, then treating loan repayments as such will result in a faster overall accumulation rate compared to if one treated them like normal spending. However, given how long most people hold on to their mortgages and student loans before finally paying off both, this seems unlikely to be significant enough to matter much unless one is looking at very large amounts of debt over relatively short time periods. For example, let us say someone takes $80k in combined mortgage & school debts when starting college; graduates 5 years later owning nothing except said debts which total around $90K upon completion - assuming he makes only minimum monthly payments throughout his entire career until retirement age hits him back down below zero again due mainly because inflation has gone crazy during that same period!

At my last job we had a lot of fun together after hours. We were all friends outside of work too. However, our boss was a bit of a dickhead who yelled at people whenever he got angry. He also gave us no direction and expected us to figure things out ourselves without asking him anything which resulted in a LOT of stressful situations. Whenever someone quit/got fired, he hired their replacement within weeks. This meant that everyone knew they were replaceable and nobody wanted to try hard unless absolutely necessary. All this added up to a high turnover rate and poor productivity. On top of that, our office space wasn't nearly big enough and we couldn't fit all the desks into one room. As a result, half of us worked in cubicles while the rest sat in open offices with no doors. Everyone was constantly distracted since noise traveled throughout the whole building. Then again, maybe none of these factors mattered to you. Maybe you enjoyed working under pressure and being paid peanuts. Maybe you liked sitting in an uncomfortably small space. Who knows? Just realize that whatever situation you end up choosing, it won't always remain exactly the same.\nAs far as finding a different job goes, consider talking to recruiters. They know a ton about companies and positions available in your field. A good recruiter can help you find jobs you wouldn't otherwise hear about plus tell you whether those jobs sound interesting or not. Another option is LinkedIn. You can use its search feature to locate past co-workers of yours who ended up moving to other places. Their profiles often include information regarding why they moved, what type of company they went to, etc. Plus, you can contact them directly via messaging system built right into the site.\nLastly, I recommend reading this article.

You say you love your job. Do you hate your commute? Are you living close enough to walk to work? How long does it take you each morning to drive to work? Could you move farther away instead of changing employers? What about parking costs? Would it cost less overall to change employer than simply switch locations? Sometimes moving isn't necessarily cheaper, especially if it involves a longer commute.\nAlso, it seems like you really care about saving money for retirement, yet you only contribute 5% to your plan. Most plans allow employees to save up to 10%, and many offer matching funds. Consider contributing more to your plan and seeing if your employer offers matching funds.

Example: tool-making, wood carving, jewelry-making.  Reserve enough time outside of work hours to make a little progress every day.  Aim to start a business selling your widgets, and gain profits from your passion.   If it starts to pick up, you may negotiate taking Tuesdays off or something to allow you more freedom in growing this pursuit.  \nAnother thing to consider is purchasing a percentage of the business.  If you have good enough savings or credit to invest in the company, such as to have a reasonable percentage of ownership, then you are effectively a partner.  As part owner, you should be able to bring up a vote to increase your own salary by a percentage at the next shareholder meeting.  If you buy a controlling stake, no votes are necessary.  \nI know two insurance salesmen.  One was working at the local Tea store for extra cash, then within a few years, bought the franchise location and only pokes his head in every two weeks or so.  The other has a huge grill and makes plastic-wrapped barbecue plates by the dozens and sells them to local businesses.  I think he even spends his lunch-break delivering them to offices around town.  \nIt's totally feasible to get a dirt cheap website set up showcasing some of your.... personalized hammers or what-have-you, and make web-sales, shipping on the weekends, of things that you made in your productive hobby-time.  You'll have a reliable income stream set up from something that used to just be TV time. "

        "question": "Affording the Nursing Home In search of financial/legal advice. Here's the situation.\n&x200B\nThe state is Minnesota. Grandmother (85) and Grandfather (86) have lived together with my Mother for the past 5+ years. Grandmother and Grandfather own their own home and are listed together on the deed. Grandmother + Grandfather have income from Social Security + pension totaling around $6,000 per month. We aren't certain about bank balance, investments, and other liquid assets.\n&x200B\nGrandmother has developed Alzheimer's/dementia. Disease has progressively grown worse to the point of being unmanagable. Situation is causing tremendous hardship/stress. The family has hired a care worker to visit on weekdays and attend to Grandmother's needs, but even so it's increasingly untenable. There are safety issues with Grandmother being unattended, and there is a constant paranoia that she might wander out of the home in the middle of the night. She basically requires constant supervision and that isn't something we're equipped to provide. We need to get her into a nursing home.\n&x200B\nCheapest nearby nursing home is $5,000 per month. Some as high as $8,000. My understanding is Medicare won't pay, Medicaid would but they would need to declare bankruptcy to qualify.\n&x200B\nQuestion is, what is the best way to get Grandmother into a nursing home with minimum out-of-pocket whilst also protecting the house from being taken away from them? Are there state/federal programs we should be aware of? What are our options?\n&x200B\nThanks.",
        "prediction": "\nPost by: Mister Imperceptible on December 14, 2017, 10:39:42 AM\nI don\u2019t know much about this subject at all - I was just going off memory of some conversations I had recently...\nIf you were moving your parents into an assisted living facility or similar, then maybe Medicare could help cover costs if the move involved hospitalization first? That\u2019s probably not relevant though since grandma sounds like she doesn\u2019t require medical assistance.\nMy sense is that Medicaid may kick in before bankruptcy occurs, although I think there are rules against transferring property prior to applying for benefits. Maybe someone else can chime in here more knowledgeably than me :)\nQuote from: Mister Imperceptible on December 14, 2017, 10:39:42 AM\nMedicare will only pay for long term stays when necessary due to illness / injury etc.. Not for normal old age.\nMedicaid kicks in after everything else runs dry. It does however make everyone eligible for food stamps. So there is that.\nA lot of people opt to sell their homes while still healthy enough to do so instead of waiting until later in life when things go bad. At least that way the proceeds can fund retirement rather than leaving it up to the government to figure it out downstream.\nThere are also reverse mortgages which allow seniors to tap into their home value without having to actually leave the house. You essentially borrow money against future appreciation and use the funds to live comfortably now. As far as I know these loans cannot be foreclosed upon unless one passes away. They do tend to accrue interest over time though. If used properly they can work well.\nWe are fortunate to already have several large lump sums set aside for emergencies, so selling the house wouldn't really change anything financially speaking. But it seems like such a big step emotionally, especially given how attached both sets of parents are to the place where they raised their families.\nBut yes, I see why that makes practical sense for those who haven't yet accumulated sufficient savings. And thanks for pointing us toward another option!\nIn most states, including mine, once you apply for Medicaid for yourself, you lose control of any non-exempt assets. Exemptions vary widely between states, but many states exempt personal possessions ($5k-$10K), household goods & furnishings (same amount), motor vehicles valued under $5k (or $10k depending on the year model), prepaid funeral plans, burial plots, life insurance policies, irrevocable trust accounts, annuities and burial expenses. Your spouse keeps his/her exemption regardless of whether he applies or not. Once approved, you must spend down to zero dollars within six months otherwise you risk losing all remaining assets to the State.\nSo if you can afford to keep the house paid off, keep it. You shouldn't give it away anyway because you want to preserve whatever cash flow you can generate during retirement. Also, if you ever decide to relocate back to the area, renters buy houses too.\nYou could look into getting Long Term Care Insurance for your mom, assuming you can find coverage for someone older. LTC premiums are based on the person's age, gender and overall good health status; rates increase dramatically every five years starting at age 50. Most carriers cap the maximum benefit available at three years. However, many carriers offer \"shared care\" riders which doubles the max benefit period to six years. For example, if you purchase a policy today for a 60 y/o woman costing $2500/year, she'll receive $250,000 worth of protection. Her children would each split that dollar amount equally among themselves. This means that the mother pays half of the premium herself, plus the two sons share the rest. A shared care rider is optional, but highly recommended in case dad develops cognitive impairment himself sometime in the next few decades. Unfortunately, no carrier offers lifetime coverage anymore.\nFor anyone considering purchasing LTCI, please consider the following:\nLifespan of average American male = ~80yo\nProbability of developing severe cognitive decline @ 80 yo= < 1%\nAnnual rate increases = 5-10%\nMaximum Benefit Period = 3yr\nTotal Premiums Paid During Life = >$",
        "answer_1": "I am a home health social worker. \nFor starters, get Grandma & Grandpa both on Medicaid. Different states have different rules about Medicaid. If they have any savings accounts, they will need to spend that money. Do NOT let them write you (or anyone else) a big check for thousands of dollars as a way of getting rid of it, it can mess up the Medicaid process and complicate it. \nIf the house is paid for, they might consider a reverse mortgage which means that the bank buys their house and makes payments to them for several years. This can also complicate the Medicaid process, so just be careful and try to get with an attorney who knows all the ins and outs of your state's Medicaid rules. \nSome nursing homes will take Grandma now if they know for sure that she will be approved for Medicaid. You'd have to call around and ask; usually there's at least one in each town that does that. \nSpeaking of nursing homes, the kind that you really want to put Grandma in is one with a memory care unit. This is a locked-door facility. Staff and visitors can come and go, but the patients stay and are entertained and fed and cared for all in the same place; they aren't allowed to wander. \nAlso, when picking a nursing home, show up unannounced for a visit. Don't call and ask them what their hours are or visiting policy or tip them off in any way that you are coming. Just show up. You don't want them to have time to make the place look nice just for your visit. \nAnd finally, these may be harder to find, but there are nursing homes in the community that look like regular everyday homes. They may not even have a sign out front. These places can be hit or miss. Some are fantastic and some I wouldn't send my worst enemy to, but by and large, their prices are actually pretty reasonable, usually in the $2-3K range. They may be listed in the phone book, or you can sometimes ask around, sometimes nurses know about them by word of mouth.",
        "answer_2": "There are a lot of provisions set forth for Medicaid to not take assets away from a community living based spouse.  Talk to an adult case worker or area agency on aging represenative.  They can help with assessing your grandmother to get her admitted to a facility and discuss the financial costs of doing so.\nIf your grandparents have savings/cincome wise and in general everything is split down the middle and everything on the side of grandma will go to pay for her cost of care.  Medicaid has a 5 year look back at all financial transactions and a case worker would be looking at bank statements, retirement accounts, stocks, etc.  Any asset.   Primary residences are normally excluded from asset checks as long as a spouse is using it as a primary residence.  Some income is also excluded from her side, for the spouse to live off of.  If there are a lot of complex accounts that your grandparents have it might be good to utilize an elder law attorney to do an application that will protect as much as possible for your grandfather's benefit.  If there is little to no savings less, then just go talk to a nursing home and work with them to put in an application with the state.  Most facilities i've worked at will help you organize the application and submit it themselves, so they actually get paid.   After everything is calculated, granddad will just pay whatever amounts decided upon out of savings and then eventually just a part of the monthly income (and then the facility bills the rest to the state for reimbursement).  Applications can take a while to approve for the state, but as long as everyone is helping with the process most facilities have no issue staying in a Medicaid pending status.\n&x200B\nIf there are any questionable gifts of large sums of money in the past 5 years (maybe longer in some states) that may make eligibility impossible."

This AMA will serve two purposes\u2026 Firstly, it allows people to learn more about how our economy works from someone who has worked within it; Secondly, it gives us another outlet to discuss current events without having them derail into political debates where no one wins.\nA little bit about myself... After graduating college back in May 2008, I started working full-time at JP Morgan Chase in their Corporate Finance department, which specializes in M&A advisory services across multiple industries. In September 2008, shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, I decided to leave banking entirely because I didn\u2019t want to participate in such a broken system anymore. Since then, I\u2019ve been trading options part-time while working several odd jobs just to make ends meet. However, I recently got accepted to Columbia Business School\u2019s Masters program in Quantitative Methods, beginning August 2012.

I was born into this settlement at the Brio Superfund site in Friendswood, Texas. The lump sums I received in 2005 paid for my education, I am now 28, 2 years into my career, married and contributing 10% towards my 401k matched 25% with no ceiling which I started in 2014. We are in the 25% tax bracket and I am in the process of saving a 6 month emergency fund along with one year of my wife's salary for her to be a stay at home mom when we have a child. My wife and I have joint accounts and we use YNAB budgeting system. We are renting-to-own our 180k home (purchased 2012) from her (rich) parents for only 400$ a month. The only debt we have is her car note which will be paid off by the end of this year.\nI am currently using this settlement money to expedite our emergency fund which I keep in a separate bank account so that it is more 'out of mind' and we are not tempted to spend it. I have no idea what to do with this money once our emergency fund is established. We are financially responsible to the point where we do not need to touch this money and can allow it to grow. Any and all tips are greatly appreciated. \nI have contemplated the idea of increasing my contributions to either my 401k or Roth (which is matched 25% as well) and making up the difference to my income with the monthly settlement money.",

If you were really satisfied where you are, wouldn't you stay put regardless of what anyone else offers you?\nAnd your statement \"...and allowed me to grow professionally\" suggests that you don't feel like you could do any better by yourself - which means either your growth potential or your skills aren't up to par yet, or both. So instead of leaving because someone else offered you something extra, maybe you ought to try working harder first?\nThis may sound harsh coming from a stranger, but you seem to have forgotten one important thing when evaluating whether or not to accept another offer; namely, the fact that the decision isn't all yours alone anymore. You will also have to consider how accepting such an offer might affect those around you, especially since you said \"I am wondering how to make a professional and amicable exit\".\nSo please take a minute and ask yourself these questions before making a final decision:\nDo you truly believe you deserve the higher pay? What makes you sure no one else at your workplace deserves it as much as you do? How many hours/days/weeks/years have gone into earning the money you currently receive? Do you honestly think others haven't done the same? Would you be willing to let them know exactly who earned what, and why? And most importantly, if you did go ahead and tell everybody, how long do you expect people to respect your privacy once word got out anyway?\nDoes your current company really care enough about you personally to keep track of everything you're doing, and to give you every single benefit available to its employees? Or does it only care about keeping costs down, and doesn't mind losing good workers along the way?\nIf you decide to move forward, are you prepared to lose friends, family members, co-workers, clients, customers etc., and never see them again? Are you ready to deal with possible repercussions if things turn sour between you and the person(s) involved? Can you handle being known as the guy who left his previous place of business under dubious circumstances?\nThese are tough questions, but unfortunately, they must be asked, even though nobody wants to admit it. It seems obvious to me that you'd be foolish to ignore anything mentioned above. But if you choose to proceed nonetheless, I hope you find happiness wherever you end up going.

I recently paid off the student loans that were directly in my name after 2 years and now I'm going to contribute to paying off that mountain.\nRight now my budget looks like this\nIncome $3960 per month (this is after taxes and assuming I don't work over time which I do at least 2 times a month)\nRent $899\nPhone $142 (it will be going down to $60 come Nov)\nInternet $20\nElectric $30\nHulu $8\nSaving $600\nAdobe CC $54 (I need this for work which makes me wonder if I can write it off on my taxes?)\nTransportation $116\nThat if my math is right means I have $2200~ left at the end of the month with some wobble room for food (which I left out because month to month what I spend on food widely varies) which just barely covers the minimum payment on the loans which based on my math means it would take me 9 years to pay them off and I would pay $74,521.93 in interest in that time which is crazy! Right now theres a balance of $488.13 in owed interest that I've set a payment for friday to pay off on top of the already scheduled required payment. \nSo I have two questions is there any feasible way for me to get a loan of equal value at a lower interest rate? And is there any other suggestion about what I could be doing to proactively tackle this loan? \nI guess I should add too every 6 months or so I get a raise, or a pay upgrade I don't know how to properly explain, I work freelance and every new job I take is a little more complex at a higher skill set so I usually negotiate a higher salary.

You can move forward with your life and not be a burden to yourself or your parents.

Student loans suck for a variety of reasons. you need to educate yourself about student loans before you will really be in a position to come up with a workable plan.  I have found Heather Jarvis' site to be very helpful:  \nIt is possible to refi your loans to obtain both a better interest rate and a lower monthly payment. Of course one of the other factors is that this involves amortizing your loans over a longer period. Which means you will pay more in the long run and it will take longer to pay off the loans. This also means going from federal to private loans which reduces the payment deferral options available to you. But if the current payment plan just isn't working then you have to change something. \nI did a quick back of the envelope calculation of 185k principle at 8% with a 10 year amortization. The monthly payment amount I am calculating is around $2200 per month. So your parents' current loans do not appear to be on any sort of income based repayment plan. \nWhen you are ready to refi you will want to shop the loans around a bit.

        "prediction": " Short $YOUTE?\n@michael_kruse @Hedgeye\n\u2014 Hedgeye (@hedgeye) March 24, 2015\n# Chapter Twenty-Two   \nThe S&P 500 Is Not the Economy and Vice Versa: The Fed Needs to Do Its Job!\n\"It is not often that one has an opportunity of seeing a man who is in love with his own opinions.\"\n\u2014 Voltaire (1694\u20131778), French writer\nIn January 2013, I made my first appearance as a guest on CNBC's _Squawk Box_. After the interview was over, I received numerous phone calls from friends and colleagues telling me how impressed they were by what I had said. In particular, many people mentioned that it seemed like I knew something about monetary policy that most investors don't know or understand. \"You seem very confident,\" some even told me directly during our conversations afterwards.\nI am humbled when others find confidence in my views; however, let me be clear here: My confidence comes from knowing why we are where we currently stand today, and more importantly, understanding exactly how the Federal Reserve will react next. As I have stated before, if you can anticipate actions rather than reactions, then you win. This doesn't mean that I always get everything right, but at least I feel comfortable enough saying this because I believe there really aren't any surprises left. At least none that would shock anyone with a basic knowledge of economics and finance anyway. And yes, I do think that many market participants have a fairly rudimentary grasp of these subjects. It's just that they choose to ignore them all together.\nTo put things into perspective, consider for a moment that the only reason someone would care about macroeconomic events such as interest rates is if he wanted to make money off those events. If you didn't want to profit from changes in economic conditions, then why bother studying them? So if you study macroeconomics, then you must intend to trade based upon your beliefs regarding future developments. That means that you either believe that current prices reflect the best possible information available (i.e., efficient markets theory), or else you expect to identify mispriced securities using fundamental analysis. Both theories imply that you need to keep up with economic data releases in order to evaluate whether or not your assumptions regarding future developments remain valid.\nFor example, suppose that you thought the economy was going to grow faster than expected. What would happen to bond yields? They should rise since higher growth implies inflation, which makes bonds less attractive. But what happens instead? Interest rates fall despite stronger growth projections. Why? Because everyone expects the Fed to raise short-term rates sooner now that unemployment is falling. Higher real GDP growth increases inflation risks without raising nominal growth forecasts, thus lowering long-term Treasury yield estimates. Meanwhile, higher risk assets are bid up due to improved business sentiment. You see, bond yields move counterintuitively because of central bank action.\nBut let's say you disagree with the consensus viewpoint on monetary policy. Then what? Well, if you still hold a position based solely upon the expectation that rising rates are bad news for equity valuations, then you may end up getting whipsawed back and forth between optimism and pessimism depending on each new release. By contrast, if you recognize that the world is changing around us, then you might sell positions ahead of time to avoid losses down the road while also buying other trades designed to benefit from the change itself. Either way, being able to predict what the Fed does helps inform traders about where asset prices could go.\nTherefore, I urge readers to take note whenever someone claims ignorance toward monetary policy matters. For starters, no one truly knows anything unless he actually reads minutes from FOMC meetings and listens closely to speeches given by members of the Board of Governors. Second, if you're too busy watching sports highlight shows to pay attention to global affairs, then maybe you shouldn't be trading stocks anymore. Third, if you refuse to read financial newspapers and blog posts written by smart analysts working at top firms, then perhaps you lack sufficient education necessary to participate meaningfully within capital markets. Finally, if you fail to realize that nearly all major decisions made by officials inside Washington DC affect public opinion towards private sector actors located elsewhere across America, then please stop complaining altogether until you become better informed.\nNow let's shift gears slightly",

Being aware how many times I go to grocery store and how much I spend on crap I don't need. This allowed me to put money into things I have to pay, or want to pay. Leading to all my debts being paid off. \nPF has been a strong force for me, just reading of stories and getting to realize that at the age of 27 I need to plan for my future. \nThen in October I started using YNAB which is great too.\nHere's how my budget looks like.

        "question": "[US] Is it realistic to make a stable living from home? The reason I am asking is because I am nearly 30 now, and most of my life I have worked for minimum wage in NYC and can barely pay my rent, bills, expenses, etc. and would like to try and save some money by cutting my transportation costs by working from home. I currently work about 90-100 hours a week for $455/week, so I have no problem investing the same amount of work hours if the pay from home is going to be about the same, so that I will be saving money on commuting to work. However, most of the \"work from home!\" opportunities either 1) sound like scams, or 2) are not financially stable enough to depend on as an income. So is it viable to actually maintain a career from home, or am I pretty much stuck in my current employment position for the foreseeable future? Because I don't have any marketable job skills that employers will be wanting to pay more for, and also after I finish work and all my responsibilities are tended to, I don't have much time left over to invest in a new employable skill such as programming.",
        "prediction": "\nI think this question may be better suited at Workplace SE: https://workplace.stackexchange.com/. \u2013 Celeritas Jul 7 '16 at 8:19\nYou need to define what you mean by \"stable\". If you just want a consistent salary then there's nothing stopping you doing that with remote work - but your quality of life might take a hit (working 90+ hrs per week isn't healthy). It'd probably help to ask here What kind of lifestyle do you expect to lead when you retire? \u2013 Chris W. Rea\u2666 Aug 23 '16 at 10:33\nWorking from Home is possible and many people do manage to do that. But it does require discipline which they often lack. There is always something else to distract them. They end up wasting their days watching TV or playing games instead of getting things done. You must really push yourself hard every day to get stuff done. Once you learn how to focus without interruption you should find it easier to continue. \u2013 Michael Lai Mar 13 at 1:55\nThere are two key aspects of being able to make a good living while working remotely. One is having experience with a field where there is demand for workers who can work independently; the other is having technical abilities sufficient to meet whatever requirements exist within those fields.\nIt sounds like you already know one side of that equation -- you've been employed full-time since high school and apparently haven't had problems finding jobs even though you aren't highly educated nor possess unique qualifications. That says to me that you likely fall into one of several categories:\nThe type of work you perform doesn't involve specialized knowledge and requires little training beyond basic literacy and numeracy skills, plus some familiarity with common office software programs. These types of positions include data entry clerks, call center agents, customer service representatives, administrative assistants, receptionists, janitors, security guards, etc. A lot of these roles were previously performed on site but are increasingly offered via telecommute arrangements due to cost savings and improved efficiency. Examples include Dell Technical Support and Sutherland Global Services.\nThis category includes professionals whose duties can be largely automated through technology and therefore don't necessarily necessitate physical presence at client locations. This could apply to someone performing accountant functions, tax preparer services, medical coding, bookkeeping, insurance claims processing, computer repair, etc., depending upon the specific tasks involved. An example is QuickBooks Online Advisor.\nSomeone who has built expertise in an area where few others share similar backgrounds or experiences. For instance, if you grew up around horses, learned everything necessary to care for them properly, and spent years gainfully employed providing equine veterinary assistance, you might be qualified to provide advice online regarding horse health issues. Another possibility might be offering consultancy services related to the development process of video game titles, based upon your past history as a programmer or designer.\nIf none of the above seem applicable to your situation, another option worth considering is becoming self-employed rather than seeking out traditional work with a company. Many people start small businesses selling products or rendering professional services locally, using websites such as Etsy, eBay, Craigslist, Angie's List, Thumbtack, Upwork, Freelancer, Fiverr, etc., to reach customers. You can also offer to write articles, create videos, produce podcast episodes, design graphics, edit photographs, compose music, translate documents, proofread manuscripts, transcribe audio recordings, teach classes, give presentations, coach sports teams, organize events, etc. Some examples include Amazon Mechanical Turk, Udemy, Skillshare, Coursera, Codecademy, Treehouse, Lynda.com, etc.\nMany companies also allow employees to choose their own schedules, allowing flexible shifts according to personal preferences. Others allow staff members to set their own rates of compensation based upon performance reviews. Employment options like these enable individuals to achieve greater control over both their lives and financial situations, giving rise to an increased sense of freedom, independence, and fulfillment.\nIn short, yes! There definitely exists a wide range of possibilities available today for anyone willing to put forth effort toward making themselves valuable assets capable meeting needs expressed by potential clients. Just remember that success takes dedication and commitment regardless whether you intend pursuing conventional forms of employment or operating under independent contractor status.

        "answer_1": "It is hard for me to believe that you work 90-100 hours a week in NYC of all places and only make $455/wk. That would make no sense due to OT laws and the fact that the minimum wage there is higher than many places in America even though it's a HCOL area. That part just sounds phony as heck. \nTo answer your question though the answer is yes, many people actually work from home. Create a website, youtube, finding legit companies that allow you to work from home, etc. You just need some type of skill set and a way to market your product. It is still work at the end of the day though. \nBy the way, if you truly do work 90-100 hours per week as you claim, it sounds like it could be illegal since NYC'S minimum wage is $11.00 per hour and at 40 hours that's $440 now add that plus overtime of 50-60 hours per week and that's $1265-$1430 per week and if no overtime that's still double what you claimed to make at $990 per week.

Unless you have some sort of contract with guaranteed increases based on tenure/performance, they could always cut your salary back down again next year. If they did so, though, then they might lose their ability to deduct part of your compensation from taxes; something worth keeping in mind when considering whether or not to look elsewhere.\nposted by Dip Flash at 9:06 AM on January 7, 2015 [1 favorite]\nAre we talking about the same place here? It sounds more like he was hired mid-year last year for $X, received no increase after six months because his boss didn't think he had earned one yet, and now received another raise because his performance improved over the course of the entire calendar year. That sounds completely normal to me - especially given how young he still is. The only thing unusual is that he doesn't mention being told why he wasn't awarded an annual increase. But maybe that's just standard practice where he works. Either way, unless he signed a contract guaranteeing him certain levels of wage growth each year regardless of performance, I wouldn't read anything into it.\nAlso keep in mind that most people get paid annually and that means that even if your employment started halfway through the fiscal year, they will likely give you a full percentage point adjustment since you were employed for all twelve months of the previous year. So while technically true that he hasn't seen a single percent change in his income, it's also fair to say that he actually saw a larger increase than the average employee. Just depends which side of things you want to focus on.\nThe fact that the company is doing better financially should make you happy too. And if you really wanted a bigger raise, I'd recommend asking them directly rather than assuming they're going to automatically match whatever everyone else gets.\nIf you are thinking of moving jobs anyway, then yes...you may find yourself facing similar situations depending upon where you go. There isn't much you can do about it except accept that you'll need to negotiate future salaries individually instead of relying on automatic increases.\nposted by Kadin2048 at 9:22 AM on January 7, 2015 [1 favorite]\nIt sounds like your company does merit reviews periodically throughout the year, and then gives out raises once per year, usually coinciding with the end of the budget cycle (so September-ish?)\nIn the US it's pretty common for companies to use the first few weeks of the new year to distribute bonuses and raises. Your company obviously decided to hold off until later, but that's nothing uncommon either.\nYour question makes it sound like you expect to receive regular raises according to set guidelines, and perhaps that expectation was communicated to you beforehand during the interview process. This is not necessarily correct -- often times employees are surprised to learn exactly how their base pay is determined, and sometimes it varies significantly between departments / managers. For example, I work in market research and it's very common for us to see huge differences in starting pay across different groups. A brand manager making $60k won't feel slighted by seeing a junior data analyst making twice as much. Likewise, if you start working somewhere else and discover that you made far below median pay, you shouldn't assume that you weren't fairly compensated for your role.\nUltimately, I suspect that this issue boils down to differing expectations, both yours and those of management. You expected XYZ amount of pay based on your experience level and past job history, whereas they expected ZYA based on their internal pay structures and priorities. Neither group is wrong in principle, but neither party probably fully understood these nuances going in. Maybe ask HR about the specifics behind your particular situation? They can explain how your position fits into the overall corporate structure, and hopefully clear up any misunderstandings.\nGood luck and enjoy the extra cash :-)\nposted by mccarty.tim at 9:41 AM",

        "question": "Citi says it \"destroyed\" my deed-in-lieu and wants a non-contested foreclosure instead In 2012, I hired a lawyer to reach a DIL agreement with Citi, which had threatened to foreclose on my underwater home (in Miami, Fla.). DIL agreement was signed in 2012 and registered in court in 2013; foreclosure proceeding stopped. The deed was returned to Citi. \nCiti, however, continued to send me mortgage statements and never changed the title, which still shows under my name (even though Citi has continued to pay the taxes and insurance). I've tried repeatedly to get it straightened out. \nIn January (2015), Citi went back to my lawyer and said it had mistakenly \"destroyed\" the DIL and asked if I would agree to an uncontested foreclosure. I said no way since signing would put a foreclosure on my credit record and expose me to taxes on the forgiven debt (since the tax exemption law expired at close of 2014). Plus, I don't really own the home. Citi does. This was all recorded in court.\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going on here? Why would Citi want to push me to foreclosure on a house that I signed over to them in 2012/2013?\nIn case it matters, I moved out in 2012 because I was relocated by my company. A friend has been living there rent-free, keeping the property up. But, there's a chance I may be moving back in the near future and I could move back into the home if there's any advantage to me doing so.\nAny advice is appreciated. My lawyer hasn't been able to explain to me why Citi doesn't just accept the terms of the DIL. Even if the document was destroyed and the deed, presumably, lost, couldn't they recognize copies of the docs?",

Thanks for your help!\n\u2014Jessica\n**QUESTION:** How do you fight against the banks when they are trying to take away our homes without due process or even following their own rules?\n**ANSWER:** You cannot fight City Hall alone. It takes organized action from the people affected. If enough homeowners band together and refuse to leave their houses unless the bank agrees to modify loans then things will change. We need more information about how many homeowners are willing to stand strong before we can make this happen.\n#  **The Banks Are Cheating Us All**\nWe all knew that Wall Street got rich off subprime mortgages but did not expect them to try to cheat us as well. However, now evidence suggests that some lenders are engaging in widespread fraud.\nRecently, Citigroup settled charges brought by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo related to allegations that the bank sold risky investments based upon false information concerning loan quality. In addition, federal regulators fined JPMorgan Chase $96 million after finding violation of regulations regarding documentation requirements during foreclosed sales of properties. And Bank of America paid $8 billion to settle claims brought by the Justice Department involving misleading customers about fees charged on credit cards and other financial products. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo admitted guilt in manipulating interest rates used to determine auto financing costs while UBS agreed to a settlement worth $78 million over similar conduct relating to adjustable rate mortgages. These cases illustrate the extent to which major institutions engaged in systemic abuses designed solely to generate profits regardless of harm done to borrowers or society generally.\nIt seems clear that these actions were motivated by greed rather than necessity given that most firms involved experienced significant losses associated with such practices despite having access to billions in government bailouts intended specifically to prevent exactly those kinds of events occurring again today. Indeed, one study found that nearly half of all home repossessions between 2008\u20132010 occurred among families making above median income levels suggesting that much larger numbers might ultimately suffer if current trends continue unabated. Furthermore, another report concluded that approximately two thirds  of distressed homeowners whose primary source of income comes from employment remain unaware that they qualify for assistance programs established through Making Home Affordable initiatives launched several years ago yet only four percent actually applied! Clearly something needs fixing urgently before millions lose everything they worked hard for throughout life thanks largely because those same individuals failed to act quickly enough when presented opportunities previously offered freely elsewhere around country.\nUltimately, addressing issues like these requires concerted efforts across entire spectrum including both consumers themselves along public officials responsible enforcement laws protect citizens rights ensure fairness justice overall economy works smoothly efficiently possible thereby creating greater economic prosperity everyone involved thus ensuring long term sustainability future generations alike come next century ahead.

For example, let us say you borrow $10K with a $9K balance left after one month. The next day you repay this loan entirely. But because they charged you $9K interest plus fees ($1K), then you actually paid only $9K +$1K = $10K. So you didn't save money, you just transferred funds from your bank account into their pocket. That is why banks love people who carry large balances. They know you cannot pay them back completely without incurring huge penalty charges. And that is exactly what they count upon. \u2013 chx Feb 24 '17 at 15:35\n@chx -- There was no mention of transferring cash from his checking to the lender\u2019s checking. In fact, he has a line item that says \u201cdebt\u201d rather than \u201ccash\u201d. He also talks about getting a lower interest rate, suggesting he may be able to refinance existing loans, possibly using proceeds from selling stocks or bonds instead of tapping his home equity further. His debt load is high relative to his net worth, but I think he knows full well that paying everything off isn\u2019t going to happen unless he stops spending. \u2013 JoeTaxpayer\u2666 Jun 13 '17 at 17:54\n@JoeTaxpayer -- You are correct. I did misunderstand OP's situation. I apologize for misrepresenting him. \u2013 chx Jun 13 '17 at 18:10\nWhile there are certainly arguments against carrying consumer debt such as credit cards, most of those arguments assume that you can't control yourself otherwise. That said, many people find themselves in situations where they simply aren't able to keep track of every dollar coming and going, leaving them unable to put aside sufficient amounts of money towards building wealth. This is especially true among younger workers. While you might feel comfortable putting away significant sums today, remember that you haven't been doing so yet. Your current salary level probably hasn't increased significantly in several years. Will it continue growing steadily forever? Probably not.\nSo yes, you absolutely must first work toward becoming financially stable before working toward accumulating assets. However, once you reach that point, you shouldn't necessarily stop saving altogether. Instead, look for opportunities to increase the amount saved per month until you hit the maximum allowable contribution limit for both IRAs and employer plans combined. Once that happens, focus on reducing the overall cost of living and increasing your emergency fund reserves.\nOnce you've reached a reasonable standard of financial stability, you can begin looking for ways to use excess funds to build wealth. At this stage, however, the priority shifts from simply keeping costs under control to ensuring adequate returns on invested capital. That requires making wise decisions regarding asset allocation. Do you really expect to earn double digit returns on your investments? Nope. Not even close. What you *can* reasonably expect, though, is somewhere between 6-10%. Assuming you'd normally expect to earn 8%, you should aim to beat inflation by at least 2% annually. That gives you room to adjust your allocations as needed depending on market conditions, economic growth rates, etc., without having to worry too much about losing ground due to low yields.\nIf you're already maxed out contributions, you still have plenty of choices available beyond direct deposits into various types of accounts offered via brokerages or mutual fund companies. Consider opening secondary business lines (such as freelancing). Alternatively, look for ways to reduce overhead costs associated with running whatever type(s) of small enterprise currently",
        "answer_1": "Yes, pay off the credit card debt as soon as possible.  You're just giving the bank money.\nGet a working budget in order, stop \"splurging\" and spending money that you don't have.  You're still young, so learn early, get some self discipline and it will make your life forward go a lot easier.",
        "answer_2": "\nWould another option be to invest in property, since it's more liquid\n\nNo. It's not more liquid.\n1) You can't just \"withdraw\" money from a house. You either sell it or you keep it.\n2) Selling takes time, effort, and money. Withdrawing money from a 401k just takes money. Since you likely won't need the entire amount of the house, the penalties from the 401k might actually be cheaper than the fees incurred from selling the house.\nAlso, do you get employer match on the 401k?\nPay off your credit cards aggressively. Then cut it up or freeze them in the freezer so you don't use them. Only buy something if you have cash for it.\nYou should not be saving anything besides a 6 month emergency fund. Most people say 3-6, but I think 6 is better if you own a house. You might have to do emergency repairs. And if you lose your income, you'll want a buffer since, again, a house is difficult to get rid of."

It seems to me that one of the biggest problems people run into after college is that they spend too much money while trying to establish themselves financially. This often leads to debilitating levels of stress, which then makes it difficult for those folks to build wealth later in life. If we can help our kids avoid this problem altogether by instilling sound financial principles early, we may well end up saving them tens of thousands of dollars over time through interest savings alone!\nThat said, here's another approach worth considering: Instead of allowing your son or daughter access to cash whenever he or she wants, why not put together a \"piggy bank\"?

        "answer_1": "I disagree with \"charging\" them. I could see that backfiring when they find out that their friends don't have to pay bills. Kids shouldn't be paying bills. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be teaching them the value of a dollar.\nHere are some of my suggestions:\n1.) Implement a chore chart and reward system. The chore chart will be based on their abilities and ages. Each day, they have chores to complete, and at the end of the week if they have completed all of their chores, they receive their allowance. \n2.) Allowance can be age-based, but doesn't have to be. For example, I wouldn't feel the need to give a 5 year old $5 weekly. They would be content with a dollar. \n3.) Each child should have a savings account. When they get their weekly allowance, double it. They put the double into their savings account. \n4.) Teach them about the \"Parent Credit Plan\". This is a fake credit card system. They can borrow money from you, but they have to pay it back within x amount of time. If they're late, that's okay, but they either have to pay a late fee, or do an extra chore. \n5.) Once they are old enough to work, they should be. It's important to work in retail for many reasons, but one key reason is learning about money. Encourage them to continue to contribute to their savings account. Have them set up a checking account with direct deposit, and teach them to set up an automatic transfer to savings. \n6.) Finally, once they are in their teens, look for a local financial 101 class. I imagine they might be offered by school districts and libraries. Like driving, managing your money is a skill that can be learned!",
        "answer_2": "I like your idea and it is similar to an idea my dad implemented. He was giving me $2 a week in middle school (1990) I was 11. I complained because my friends seemed to be getting about $5 a week on average. When I complained he told me he would give $42 a month, a large upgrade on the average my friends were getting. However, I had to pay for my own shoes and he budgeted for me to pay for 2 lunches at school per week within the $42/month. It was $1.25 for lunch at the time. He also told me I could pack my own lunch for free whenever I wanted. Guess who started making a $30 pair of shoes last a year? Guess who stopped eating school lunches? Guess who started stockpiling money? Guess who has zero resentment for his parent 23 years later? I was able to start saving enough money to pay for my own computer. I was not responsible for \"rent\" or \"electric bill\" or food in general. I was responsible for a couple of items that children or pre-teens can certainly handle. I learned a valuable lesson. I have known how to save money since I was 11. I will be implementing a similar program with my kids when they appear to be ready.\nIn general, though, I do agree with the other comments on this thread that are talking about you giving them $20 and then taking back $15 for necessities you provide. I don't think that is the best idea. Give them the allowance, tell them what their allowance covers, and be strong to not give them extra money for those things included in the allowance. My parents would sometimes give me an advance on the next week's allowance when it got close to the next \"pay period,\" but I think they should have skimmed %5 off the top like a payday advance might.\nHow old are they? What age do you want to start the money lessons?"

I am married with two kids under five years old. My husband works full time and earns roughly $40k per year while I stay home and take care of our children. Our combined income is roughly $50K per year. We currently live in a small townhouse worth approximately $100,000. I also own three rental properties valued between $25,000-$35,000 each. My net worth is somewhere near zero right now.\nWe recently moved to this area where housing prices are ridiculous compared to other parts of Canada. For example, we could buy a brand new house in Vancouver for less than half the price of buying an older house in Toronto. As such, we decided to purchase a small house rather than rent. We purchased our first house last September for $140,000 cash. We did this by selling both houses I owned previously and using the proceeds along with whatever equity I built up in those homes. After renovating the place somewhat, we managed to sell it earlier this spring for $170,000. With the sale of that property came a nice little profit ($30,000). However, the mortgage we took out to finance its construction ended up costing more than $20,000 once interest, legal fees and closing costs were factored in. That means I actually lost $10,000 overall.\nIn May, we found ourselves needing another residence. Due to the low inventory levels, we were unable to find anything suitable within our budget range. We finally settled upon purchasing a larger house for $220,000. Once again, we used most of our available funds to make the deal happen. In addition, we borrowed $60,000 against the value of my existing rental properties. To cover these expenses, I sold yet another investment property. Unfortunately, this particular transaction resulted in a loss of $10,000. At present, I owe $130,000 towards repairs, furniture, appliances, taxes, etc., for our current residence. And yes, we still haven't made a single payment toward the principal amount owing on the mortgages. All told, we spent almost everything we earned during the past few months trying to keep our heads above water financially speaking. During this period, we also accumulated nearly $30,000 in debts through our personal lines of credit. Finally, we have two young boys who require expensive clothing and school supplies every six weeks.\nRecently, things started going south fast. My husband suffered a serious injury",

This includes utilities, groceries, transportation costs (gas), insurance premiums, cell phone bill, internet service fees; basically anything you spend monthly should be included within your budget plan along side housing costs such as rent/mortgage payment(s) which depend upon location plus property tax rates set annually per county office responsible.\nAlso factor into account any additional income sources such as child support / alimony payments made directly towards debts accrued during marriage including credit cards balances owed etcetera.....\nThis doesn't mean \"get rid\" of everyone close to you--it means cut ties with unhealthy ones and maintain contact with healthier individuals who inspire growth rather than stagnate progress forward toward goals achieved.\nIt also helps immensely if one lives alone versus sharing space amongst roommates whom may become distractors rather than motivators thus preventing true success from occurring via following directions provided above mentioned steps taken prior leaving parental abode behind forevermore!!\nYou sound like a typical teenager trying to grow up fast. I suggest you stay with your mother until she gets tired of you. She will eventually throw you out onto the streets and then things will really begin to change.\nWhen you turn 18 years old, it does not matter anymore.

You should check with HR. They might want you to fill out some forms saying what percentage you wish taken off as withholding.

Your withholding can change from paycheck to paycheck depending on how large the paycheck is - the amount withheld is calculated from IRS formulas and assumes each check is representative of your annual salary.

If you've withheld more throughout the year than you owe  when you file, you get a refund.

There are many choices for this including [TD Ameritrade](http://us.tdameritrade.com/), ETrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, etc. These firms offer free or low cost trading platforms as well as mobile apps which allow you to trade from anywhere at almost any time.\n\nOnce your account has been established then there are two ways to do it - either manually selecting each company one by one based upon their name, ticker symbol, industry sector, etc., or using automated tools such as Stock Rover which allows users to select filters according to their own criteria and automatically generate lists of potential candidates. It also provides extensive financial data for most publicly listed U.S. equities going back over ten years along with news articles written about those companies during the past week(s). This helps determine if they may be undervalued relative to current market conditions and whether there could potentially exist opportunities due to negative press being released into markets via social media channels prior to official announcements made through mainstream outlets such as Bloomberg TV & Radio Network among others who cover these types events regularly throughout daily programming schedules across various television networks worldwide every day without fail since its founding date nearly four decades ago now known simply today merely \"Bloomberg\" only after changing ownership hands several times over course history thus far alone already seen countless changes come forth resulting ultimately leading us all towards what we call ourselves currently living within modern society today...\n\nSo basically my point was that it takes more than just knowing how much money someone makes per month; rather understanding why they make it matters too because sometimes people will spend less than usual while earning even higher amounts overall thereby increasing profit margins significantly compared against previous periods beforehand allowing them greater flexibility moving forward should anything unexpected happen down road ahead no matter what happens next afterwards eventually arrives finally getting things done correctly once again after everything else fails miserably yet still manages somehow succeed somehow miraculously despite whatever obstacles stood between both parties involved initially trying desperately hardest possible hoping something would work out sooner rather later instead waiting around forever until end result shows itself clearly visible right away showing everyone else exactly same exact scenario happened earlier already occurred previously multiple occasions long gone passed bygone days ago forgotten memories lost somewhere deep inside brain recesses never ever thought existed anymore anyway except maybe dreamland nightmarish scenarios unforgettable experiences never ending stories told aloud loud enough echo off walls reverberate sounds bounce back off ceilings crash land onto floors shatter glass windows break doors open close shut locks barred gates secured safeguarded protected safe guarded securely locked up tight closed cased sealed securely latched bolted chained padlocked tied bound handcuffed cuffed restrained held captive imprisoned jailed incarcerated trapped stuck stuck fast frozen solid iced cold solidified melted liquidized dissolved evaporated vapourised volatilised sublimated condensed compressed crushed squashed flattened smooshed pulverised powdered ground minced chopped sliced diced cut broken torn ripped pulled yanked dragged hauled heaved hoisted lifted raised elevated suspended hanged hung drawn quartered disembowelled eviscerated castrated emasculated neutered deprived depleted deficient deficient shortfall loss insufficiency lack dearth absence void vacancy gap hole space nothingness nonentity null naught zero zilch nada nil nix zip zippo goose egg blank nothing at all nothin not a single solitary damn thing absolutely no way shape form nor fashion not even remotely conceivable feasible imaginable contemplative ponderous considerations possibilities probabilities conjectures speculations theories hypotheses postulate proposals suppositions assumptions presumptions guesswork inferences deductions extrapolation interpolation interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpolations interpol",

I come with a question, which may be one I can answer myself after I write it, because I feel like writing it out here will help me process it. Nonetheless, I look to all of you for some guidance.\nI work 40 hrs a week at roughly $30 an hour. My twice-monthlg paycheck is, at minimum, about 1800$. I own a rental property which grosses about 1900$ a month. I receive $200 from my girlfriend since she's on my insurance and phone. My monthly income is $5700 unless my math is way off.\nI have student loans, insurance, credit cards, utility bills, phone bills. Normal stuff, everyone has. And the mortgage. If I add my bills up, I come to about 4000$ per month. \nThat doesn't take into account gas for my vehicle, which varies but I would estimate about $100 monthly. I smoke about a pack a day, which is about $300 a month. Yuck. I know. So maybe $4400 a month.\nIt leaves me with about 1300 a month left to spend. \nI find myself scraping by, sometimes, lately more often than not, resorting to using my credit card to cover my ass. I used to spend a lot gambling; I rarely gamble any more knowing the consequences of doing so, and I am able to hold back when I get the urge. Aside from gambling, I'd say my other vice is eating out at nice restaurants and going on expensive weekend getaways.\nMy question is, how do I get back on my feet, and maintain stability? I'm tired of trying to do this and get nowhere. I want to be able to have fun and save money, but I'm just not able to. Do I need to stop having fun and just save money? How do I change my lifestyle so drastically and even more so, how do I change my girlfriend and my lifestyle? We're used to it and I know it's one of the things that makes us happy.\nBut I want to be able to save money. Have a backup plan when everything fails. Because it seems like that part of life is inevitable.\nSo Reddit, what are your thoughts? Any good advice for a guy? Thank you for reading!

Not much information there either. He might be living off of savings. It looks like she was living paycheck-to-paycheck up until recently (based upon the credit card debts). If they were married then he would probably inherit half of everything if she passed away. But as unmarried partners who are both disabled, their assets could go to whomever inherits them. This will depend largely on where they live though - laws vary by state/province/country.\nTheir combined net worth isn't even enough to cover a decent used car. They have $3k saved between two bank accounts. That seems pretty low given how many years they've worked together. Maybe they're saving for something specific? Or maybe they spend more than they make because they don't feel like they really have any choice due to disabilities? Hard to tell without knowing anything else. And yes, I agree that they should get professional help if possible.\nAs far as jobs...I see lots of \"entry\" positions being advertised right now. A lot of companies hire temps so they don't have to give benefits while training someone new. Many companies offer tuition reimbursement programs these days too. I also know several older folks who went back to school part time after retiring early. The key thing here is determination. You may want to try doing volunteer work first if you aren't ready yet financially to take a paid position. There are tons of opportunities out there depending on your interests and skills. For example, my friend does medical transcription for free through a local hospital program.

People who cannot pay the mortgage without the rental income are people who will get into serious trouble sooner or later.)\nThey make very optimistic assumptions about rental income rates. It varies market to market, but most rental rates aren't going to cover mortage+tax+insurance, let alone mortgage+tax+insurance+maintenance+transaction costs+capital costs. Active real estate investment is a generally a long game where your eventual profit comes via capital gains and rent increases.\n\nAgain, let me be 100% clear, I am not against real estate investing. I just think that it is often portrayed with very rose colored glasses on investment boards. Sure, if you can find an excellent property, with excellent tenants, and excellent appreciation you will make out great. But, just like stocks, not every pick is a winner and it's harder to get diversification when owning properties directly. Unfortunately, I think we only hear from the winners and not the losers so we get a biased perspective.",

I had the privilege of being able to work jobs in my field throughout college and summers (including Co-ops) and have all that money go straight into my savings account.\nFor the past ~6 years, whenever I have had more than $800 in my checking account, I move the difference into my savings. Now that I am graduating, it's sitting at about $20,000. I set up the savings account when I got into college, and I don't really understand it. For example, I moved $3000 into it at the beginning of January and the next day I got $6.24 in interest on 1/24. I moved another $450 over a few days later and on 2/24 I got $7.33 in interest. I haven't moved any money over since then, and on 3/24 got $0.83 in interest. I use a Southern regional bank called BancorpSouth... I love them because they're really good with security (I get calls about my own purchases saying \"this isn't like you, can you authorize this?\" or \"we don't have any indication you would be making a purchase in this state, can you authorize this?\" just from going two states over). However when I've traveled out of the South, sometimes I haven't had access to an ATM without crazy fees, so I feel like I need a more nationally (& internationally) available bank.\nI'm inherently frugal and hard working, but never really paid attention to finances. I feel like I need to put all this savings into one of those compound interest kind of accounts. \nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n\nWhat bank should I open a savings account with?

First off, I'm not new to reddit, but I am going through a wretched divorce and have created a new username since my STBX knows my old username.  \nI have rented a house for myself and my kids with the intentions of being here a couple of years, until I can get my divorce done and finances in shape enough to buy a place of my own.  I have previously owned a home on my own, and with my STBX, however he has gotten us into so much debt that my credit isn't in good enough shape to buy, and we really need to focus on paying down the debt he created and our divorce before I even consider buying a place of my own.  My kids are 12 an 14 and are very happy with their school situation and doing very well in the current school, so I need to stay in a certain town to keep them in the school district.  I found a house to rent that I an afford- it it exactly what I wanted, I could bring my dog, and we moved in (I signed a one year lease, with my landlord hoping I would signe a 2 year, but I was hesitant and just signed a one year, but I definitely want to stay here for the foreseeable future) in October.  Come to find out, this house is going into foreclosure (the bank delivered some paperwork here from the loan remediation dept and my friend who does mortgages was able to somehow look up the house online and find out that the owners are in fact in default on their loan- public records, she didn't do anything shady).  I mail my landlord the rent each month.  I never see them- I am responsible for snow removal and yard maintenance per my lease- but I did call to let him know he had a letter from Bank Of America and he asked that I leave it out by the front door and he would be by to get it.  He hasn't been by to get in in almost 2 weeks.\nSO- I'm a bit worried about what is going to happen.  I do love it here and would like to remain living here.  Obviously I need to talk to my landlord, however he hasn't really been upfront with me about the status of the house so I am looking for info, facts, advice as to what my legal options are, if and when I will be made to leave here, etc.  I am in the Northeast of the US.\nThanks in advance.

I am 27 and I realized that I have about five credit cards in my own name and naturally I have high balances on them. I am wondering if it may be worth trying to pay them down and close them out and just keep my two or three longest standing lines of credit? I know closing them out affects my credit score , but my credit score is probably garbage as is.  ",
        "prediction": " ------------------------------\nI think you are confusing \"credit\" with \"debt\". Credit means having access to money, debt means owing someone else money. You can't get a mortgage without good credit (meaning your FICO scores), but you don't need any credit at all for a car loan. So when people talk about how much credit they want/need, what they really mean is: What amount of debt do I feel comfortable taking on right now? And then, how long does it take me to repay this new debt before I add more? That's why some folks advocate carrying no balance from month to month, while others say that's too risky because life happens -- an illness or job loss could throw off those plans. The key is knowing yourself well enough so that you understand both the risk AND the reward of each decision you make regarding borrowed money. If you had $10k cash sitting around and didn't want interest compounding over time, would you invest it instead? Or buy something expensive? Or put it into savings where it earns less than inflation?

        "prediction": "\nI do know that I can get approved for a secured card from capitalone but it would be nice if there were other options out there... Any suggestions are appreciated! Thanks in advance :)\nRe: First Credit Card - Applying Questions\nIf you already have that account then your score won't change so it shouldn't matter when they check your report. It may only show up on reports pulled by Capital One since they own the portfolio. If you haven't used that account yet though its possible that having it could help boost your score some depending on what their system looks at.\nYou really need to find something better than a student credit card. The rates tend to be high, limits low, fees high and terms short. You'll end up paying more interest over the long run even if you make all of your minimum payments. Get a regular unsecured credit card instead.\nThe best way to build good credit history without using debt is through responsible use of revolving accounts such as credit cards, lines of credit, retail store charge cards, gasoline company charge cards, department stores and medical bills. To build a positive payment record, try to keep balances below about half of your available limit. Keep your utilization rate under 20% ideally. That means if your total balance was $5000, you wouldn\u2019t carry any higher than $1000 worth of charges each month. This helps improve your CIBIL Score.",

        "prediction": " again guys! You're great!\nHi there, BR. First off... Welcome aboard! Second: I've gotta say it: you've come to the right place for advice about your financial issues. We'll try our best to help you out here.\nIt sounds as though you're in quite a bit of trouble financially. In fact, according to your post above, you seem to be headed downhill fast. It also seems from what you said that you have little or no savings, which means you could get hit by any number of life-changing events such as losing your job due to layoffs, having medical expenses beyond your ability to cover them, etc., without much hope of getting back on track. This is why people end up living with their parents into adulthood these days--because they simply cannot afford to go anywhere else. And unfortunately, once someone reaches age 29 or so, he tends not to find many options available to him other than moving back in with mom & pop. Of course, sometimes even those aren't always possible either because of various circumstances.\nBut anyway, let's talk about how you might improve your position. Here goes:\nYou need to stop spending every single penny that comes into your hands. You should start saving instead, especially since you've mentioned that you may soon face unforeseen costs related to your grandfather's illness. If you were able to put aside $50 per month toward emergency funds, then you would likely avoid the sorts of problems that caused you to lose your car payment recently. Start small; perhaps $25 or $10 per week will work better for now until you build more momentum behind your efforts. Just remember: when times get tough, the first thing everyone does is cut corners where they can. That includes eating out less often and cutting cable TV service, among others. So think about doing exactly those two things, too. They'd really add up over time and make a big difference in your budget each month. But whatever amount you decide upon, set it aside in a separate account (a \"high interest\" online checking account might serve well) and leave it alone unless something happens requiring immediate access to it. Otherwise, consider it off limits except for true emergencies.\nIf you did manage to pull together enough cash to move away from your folks', then renting would probably prove cheaper than buying a home. However, rental rates tend to increase faster than mortgage amounts (i.e., principal + interest); therefore, you run the risk of ending up worse off than before if prices rise while you remain trapped under lease terms that won't allow increases. Even if property values remained flat overall during the term(s) of your tenancy, then landlords typically adjust rent levels periodically based on market conditions anyway regardless whether they actually experience increased operating costs themselves. These factors combined mean that it pays dividends to buy rather than rent whenever possible--especially given today's depressed housing markets nationwide. Still, assuming you didn't inherit anything large lately nor win millions playing Powerball Lottery, chances are slim that you'll ever accumulate sufficient equity within 6+ yrs after purchasing a starter home anywhere near where Mom lives currently. Thus, it appears unlikely that owning vs. renting makes sense longterm for anyone looking solely at numbers alone. Instead, focus primarily upon finding ways to reduce monthly overhead wherever feasible through smart shopping habits, frugal living strategies, and wise investment decisions along similar lines. Remember: Every dollar saved adds another layer of protection against unexpected hardships further down line. Plus, keeping close tabs ensures peace mind knowing everything remains secure despite changes happening outside walls.

You could use some advice from an accountant/financial planner that specializes in helping young professionals like yourself prepare for retirement - here in Ontario there is a group called Young Advisors Network - maybe something similar exists where you live too.\nWithout knowing more details, here are a few suggestions based on what little info we got\u2026\nIf you don\u2019t expect to remain employed with the same company then yes, you probably will eventually need another source of funds. The thing to keep in mind though is that the investment options available within your current pension are likely not as good as those outside it. So, you might consider opening up a self-directed brokerage account and starting to make contributions there instead. This would give you greater control over exactly how you allocate the money. As well, depending on your age, contribution limits for your new account may allow you to max it out each year while still being able to contribute the maximum allowed towards your existing pension. In other words, having both types of accounts simultaneously gives you access to even higher amounts of tax deductible contributions.\nAs far as what happens to any future accumulations inside your pension plan once you leave \u2013 this depends on many factors including whether you were contributing voluntarily before leaving, length of time you worked, and various rules specific to individual plans. Your best bet is to talk directly to someone at HR to find out exactly what applies to yours specifically.\nposted by jessamyn at 10:21 AM on July 19 [3 favorites]\nJust to clarify, the pension plan is completely separate from any sort of retirement saving that I am making myself through my bank; these aren't connected in anyway. It just seems kind of silly to me because I'm putting away such a big chunk of my salary automatically, yet I won't see anything back unless I work for the government until I'm dead.\nIt does seem weird to me that I shouldn't try to save extra money for my old age on top of what I'm doing with the pension plan. Is there anyone else besides the government that provides this type of benefit? Or perhaps there are ways to \"opt out\" of this part of my compensation package?\nposted by mr_roboto at 11:02 AM on July 19\nYour pension is actually a very valuable asset indeed. Even if you never intend to draw upon it again after leaving gov't service, selling off half of its value today might net you $30K+. A lot of people put down roots somewhere and end up spending the next several decades enjoying a nice government pension, so it makes sense to take advantage of this free money. Of course, this isn't true for everyone -- if you'd rather spend your golden years traveling the world, then sure, sell everything you can possibly afford to cash out early.\nAlso, ask around. Some governments let employees transfer their pensions between jurisdictions. For instance, I used to work for the provincial gov't, and had the option to move my entire pension across the border to BC's system. Not everybody has this option, but it doesn't hurt to check.\nposted by oulipian at 11:03 AM on July 19\nThe only reason why you wouldn\u2019t want to contribute to an RRSP is if you anticipate receiving a large lump sum payment shortly afterwards\u2014for example, due to inheritance or divorce settlement. Otherwise, RRSPs are excellent vehicles for building long term wealth. And as others have said, you\u2019re already benefiting from one form of deferred gratification via your government pension, so adding another layer of delayed gratification to your financial strategy sounds reasonable.\nThat said, if you feel strongly enough about the issue, you could always reach out to human resources at your office and explain that you\u2019d prefer to divert some portion of your pension deductions to personal savings, especially given that you currently don\u2019t participate in either a matching program nor a defined benefits scheme.

You can take out HELOCs against your existing property or refinance with an FHA option ARM which would allow you to get some cash back from the transaction without putting any more risk on yourself than what you already face. The main thing that you want to do is make sure that if rates rise significantly over the course of this time frame, then you will still have enough income coming in each month so that there won't be too big of a shock when those bills come due again later on down the road.

The equity in your current home is useless in the initial purchase (although it can be great for a subsequent refi). I would save it in a high-yield savings account, or possibly in CDs (with maturity planned for when you'll start house hunting).\nA five year time horizon puts a lot of risk on an investment - it's not long enough to ensure that it doesn't temporarily lose significant value by the time you need it.

        "prediction": " -Jeffrey\nRe: Inherited Debt Questions & Advice Needed\nOriginally Posted by JeffreyT\nIs there anything that can be done to avoid this?\nYou cannot \"avoid\" inherited debt; however, you might be able to negotiate an arrangement where your mother agrees to pay off the creditors voluntarily rather than having them come after everyone who is named on the decedent's Will as beneficiary of assets/property. This does happen sometimes when the person dies without sufficient funds available to cover their obligations. However, such arrangements require significant negotiation skills because often times family members do not want to give up property which they believe should belong to them instead of being distributed according to what the deceased directed through his estate planning documents. The only way around these issues is usually through mediation services offered at no cost from local courts throughout most states across America today. Mediation involves both parties sitting down together face-to-face while working toward finding solutions acceptable by each party involved. Once agreed upon terms have been reached then everything else becomes irrelevant until further notice otherwise stated within contractual agreement(s).\nIn order for something like this scenario above mentioned earlier involving inheritance versus distribution via probate court proceedings comes under consideration first thing needs doing before anything else happens next step forward would include contacting respective attorney representing interested persons directly responsible making decision whether continue pursuing matter legally binding nature moving ahead accordingly based solely upon facts presented situation itself alone thus far determined fairly accurate assessment outcome potential results forthcoming timeframe duration concerned period involved total sum invested effort expended effort exertion required conclusion achieved final result desired outcome expected fulfilled completed finished resolved closed case filed away stored safe secure location accessible whenever needed again later date future dates events occur unexpected emergency situations arise unexpected circumstances arise unforeseen obstacles appear roadblocks prevent progress forward continued success achievement completion objective goals aspirations desires dreams wishes hopes prayers answered finally fulfillment realized complete satisfaction accomplished accomplished successful victory won victory earned hard work dedication commitment devotion perseverance determination persistence focus attention concentration energy efforts spent time investments placed trust faith hope belief confidence love support encouragement motivation inspiration guidance counsel advice wisdom knowledge understanding insight awareness perspective vision clarity purpose meaning goal aim objectives ambitions accomplishments achievements victories triumphs conquests wins battles conflicts struggles challenges difficulties hurdles barriers obstructions hindrances impediments delays obstructionists adversaries detractors opponents enemies foes competitors rivals antagonists counterparts counterparts opponents adversaries opposites contrasts differences variations dissimilarities distinctiveness diverseness divergence divergencies difference variance distinction variation disparateness disagreement dispute discord conflict clash battle war struggle fight combat skirmish duel contest brawl quarrel tussle scuffle altercation ruckus commotion fracas disturbance tumult agitation turmoil riot rebellion mutiny uprising revolt insurrection revolution coup d\u2019\u00e9tat putsch overthrow usurpation seizure takeover hostile occupation capture acquisition appropriation confiscation nationalization socialism communism fascism capitalism democracy republic monarchy dictatorship oligarchy plutocracy aristocratocracy royalty feudalism slavery serfdom bondage indentured servitude peonage wage labor exploitative abuse mistreated treated ill-treated tortured maltreated harmed wrongfully harmful hurt damaged broken injured maimed crippled paraplegic quadriplegic armless amputee handless footless kneeless legless blind sightless hearing impaired speech impairment voice impairment mobility restricted immobile nonambulatory wheelchair bound invalid disabled impaired incapacitated unable capable capable able functional efficient effective useful valuable important necessary vital essential critical urgent pressing imperative mandatory compulsory required forced coerced bullied intimidated threatened blackmailed extorted manipulated controlled dominated oppressed suppressed repressed restrained constrained limited curtailed prohibited blocked stopped interfered interrupted hampered thwarted frustrated stymied hindered held back delayed postponed suspended halted slowdown stoppage delay delaying stop stopping blocking forbidding denying refusing rejecting turning down declining refraining holding back withholding keeping back holding onto retaining possession of ownership rights title deeds leaseholds mortgages liens charges interest taxes penalties fines dues levies tariffs duties rates quotas limits restrictions limitations regulations rules laws codes ordinances statutes constitutions charters covenants compacts",

        "prediction": " But what else could be done now that it's too late?\nposted by anonymous to Work & Money (2 answers total) 1 user marked this as a favorite\nFirstly, if you are worried about your own credit history being affected because of your friends actions, contact the Credit Bureaus directly and dispute any errors which may appear on your file. This is not just applicable when someone has been declared bankrupt or had CCJs etc registered against them; even small blips like these can adversely effect anyone trying to obtain finance - particularly mortgages! You can find more info here: http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/credit_reports_and_scores/how_to_dispute_an_item_on_your_report/. If there isn\u2019t anything on there which needs disputing, then relax \u2013 it won\u2019t show up unless somebody checks specifically for such things.\nIf you have a joint account with your friend, make sure that either both names are removed from the account or only yours remains active after payments cease. This prevents future problems arising over who owes money where each party thinks they owe nothing at all\u2026\nAlso worth checking whether insurance companies might offer cover against rental default e.g., LV= Landlords Insurance provides protection against loss caused through tenants failing to keep up repayment commitments under agreements made during occupancy periods (up until six weeks prior to termination date), including missed instalments resulting from nonpayment / repossession orders issued following legal proceedings initiated within twelve months preceding expiry timeframe specified above.\nFinally, ensure you know exactly what rights exist regarding deposits paid towards property rentals before entering into contractual obligations related thereto\u2014this includes understanding provisions relating backdated charges levied upon premises once vacant possession achieved without reference made toward refundable security amount(s)/fee(s)! Good luck :)\nAnswer: 1.) First thing first : Get yourself a copy of your credit report from Experian.\nThe easiest way would be via post using a form provided online however some people prefer doing it themselves via telephone call instead since this method requires less paperwork involved whereas postal delivery takes longer than expected sometimes depending on location plus weather conditions among other factors contributing towards overall efficiency levels experienced while conducting transactions involving mail service providers such as Royal Mail amongst many others across UK territory boundaries alike!!!\n2.) Once received, carefully review every single detail contained inside document thoroughly making note about any discrepancies found along route journey leading us closer towards answering questions raised earlier today asking 'How Does An Eviction Affect Your Credit?!' As far as we understand currently based solely upon information supplied thus far appears unlikely scenario happened recently resulted negatively impacting score significantly enough warrant further investigation required moving forward!!!\n3.) Now comes tricky part ; determining extent damage inflicted depends largely upon severity level reached thereby requiring careful consideration given current situation presented itself clearly defined parameters set forth previously allowing accurate assessment performed accurately giving readers insight needed properly address issues addressed appropriately going forward...\n4.) Assuming worst case scenario occurred leaving behind unresolved issues still need resolved immediately afterwards involves filing formal complaint against responsible parties accordingly ensuring proper documentation obtained pertaining specific incident reported effectively bringing matter closure quickly efficiently reducing potential risk exposure faced individuals involved ultimately saving everyone involved considerable amount valuable resources utilized throughout process moving forward......\n5.)

        "prediction": "\nIn fact, even before the Great Depression started, many people had already lost their life savings because they trusted banks and bankers who were not honest enough or smart enough to avoid getting caught up in the Panic of 1837, which caused the collapse of several major American banks leading to a decade long depression. The lesson here: don't put all your eggs into one basket! Diversify among different types of assets so that if something happens to one type, another can pick up the slack. This way, when bad things happen - like panics due to economic conditions beyond our control - you will still come out ahead overall.  \n#  **How Much Should You Invest**?\nIf someone told me \"I am going to save $X per month until I reach Y years old,\" then I know exactly how much money he needs to set aside each month based on his rate of return assumption. However, most people do not plan far enough ahead; instead they just try to figure out what amount of cash flow they need now without considering future requirements later down the road. If someone said \"My salary increases every two years\" then I might tell them to invest more than usual during those periods where income growth exceeds inflation rates while decreasing contributions during times when wages are flat or declining relative to prices paid by consumers (either because unemployment remains high or consumer demand weakens). It doesn\u2019t matter whether these changes occur once every five months versus twice annually\u2014the important part is understanding why certain amounts work better under certain circumstances rather than blindly following whatever seems appropriate given current facts alone.\n#  **What Is Your Rate Of Return**?\nThe rate of return refers to the percentage gain made on any particular asset class within its respective benchmark period (usually measured against itself). For example, let us say that last year's average annualized yield across all U.S.-based large cap equity mutual fund managers was around 6%. Now suppose you bought shares in one specific company whose earnings grew faster than expected causing its price appreciation above par levels resulting in higher returns compared others'. Wouldn\u2019t it stand true then that since yours performed better than everyone else did therefore it must also mean yours earned greater profits than anybody else right? Wrong answer unfortunately since according standard practice only includes those companies listed exclusively inside America whereas mine included foreign ones too making comparison unfair thus invalidating conclusion reached earlier about superior performance achieved through smarter choices alone..\n#  **Diversification And Volatility Reducer**\nA diversified portfolio reduces volatility, meaning that the ups and downs of individual securities cancel out each other. A well-diversified portfolio provides protection against unexpected losses while providing opportunities for gains. Portfolios that include both domestic and international holdings tend to perform better over longer horizons than those focused solely on either region.

        "answer_1": "I think the conventional wisdom is generally too conservative, but that is because most people either don't save enough for retirement or choose speculative, more volatile investments, and the investing industry is biased toward trying to protect the public from itself.\nI do believe in gradually upping your exposure to bonds as you get closer to retirement, but not in huge dramatic moves, and I still want 50% of 60% of my stash in equities even post-65. Assuming you're going to live another 25 or so years from retirement day, you still want a slice of your portfolio chasing growth -- your 80s-decade money.\nThe two problems with your scenario are: one, you can't know \"when the stock market is really high\" without a time machine, so you will never know the ideal moment to do a big dump toward lower-risk investments. And, two, if you stay in a \"balanced stock portfolio with essentially no bonds\" right up until retirement day, and then we have another 1987-scale crash the day before you retire, you are entirely screwed. Any asset you want to tap within five years should be somewhat sheltered from the vicissitudes of the equities markets.",

I see nothing wrong with diversifying and switching pretty slowly toward more bonds and safer Treasuries as to protect your investments for the short term for when you retire.

You\u2019ve all been great, and I now know of plenty of options I didn\u2019t have before!\nMy grandma is 94 years old, suffers from dementia, and I am her power or attorney. She doesn\u2019t have much money remaining, about 6 months left of living expenses, as her caregivers are extremely expensive. I\u2019d like to keep her out of a nursing home as long as possible. In her safety deposit box, we discovered several ounces of gold and platinum, probably close to $40K worth. She also has a lot of jewelry we would be able to sell to continue paying for her care.\nI am skeptical though of the places that advertise \u201cWE WILL BUY YOUR GOLD\u201d because I know that those businesses have the incentive to pay you the least amount possible, so they can turn around and sell the metals at a profit. I\u2019d really like to get the most money for them as possible, and I have no idea where I can do that without dealing with a place that seems like a pawn shop type of business model.\nDoes anyone have any knowledge or experience in this situation that could give some advice?",

You can give them a call and I'm sure they will walk you through the process.  \nRemember too that they refine the stuff, i.e. melt it down and remove any alloys (other stuff in jewelery that isn't gold) and you get paid for the actual volume of the precious metals.

That's my acceptable range.  \nTalk with a tax preparer before you sell.  It sounds like you need to sell this to pay current expenses, but you should know the tax issues before you sell.  My guess is that you would sell now, any tax burden would go to grandma, but her income is low, and there might be deductions that make the income from the sale largely deductible."

The tenant wants to renew the lease for another 10 years. Basic info about the tenant: sends us prepaid cheques for the entire year, no trouble, polite man, pays on time. \nHere's the tricky question: for the renewal lease, the tenant is willing to assume all the payments for property tax, GST/QST sales taxes, school taxes, mortgage and insurance - all these costs are fixed costs that must be paid yearly and adds up to roughly $40K. The annual rent income will be around $60K. This is for the next upcoming 10 years. On our side, we won't have much expenses to pay since it's all consumed by the tenant and I assume my net income would be 60K-5K= 55K.\nNow my father wants to add another condition \"net,net,net\" on top of the things mentioned earlier, meaning the tenant must now pay for their own major repairs and every other future costs. Obviously, the tenant is unwilling to do that now.

It\u2019s no secret that credit card balances, student loan payments and mortgages take up a large portion of people\u2019s disposable income. But did you know that carrying high levels of unsecured personal debts also has negative effects on retirement planning?\nResearch shows that those who carry excessive amounts of consumer debt typically save far less toward achieving financial independence later in life. That\u2019s why reducing existing obligations now \u2013 especially revolving lines of credit \u2013 is essential if individuals wish to achieve true economic freedom later on down the road.\nFor starters, let\u2019s look at some hard numbers. Recent studies indicate that households headed by someone aged 65+ had nearly three times more unpaid medical bills than families led by younger adults (aged 35\u201344), suggesting older folks are more likely to experience unexpected healthcare",

A bit of background, my wife was a teenager during the recession, and her family was hit pretty hard since her dad works as a real estate appraiser. They went from having a really comfortable life to having nothing for several years. There were a lot of nights they went hungry.

        "prediction": "\n---  \n  |\nQ: Why are there so many people who struggle financially if all you need to know is what Dave Ramsey teaches?\nA: The reason why most people don't succeed with finances (and probably anything else) is because they believe something isn't true until someone proves it to them. In other words, \"I won't listen unless someone tells me.\" It doesn't matter whether it comes from an expert, friend, parent, teacher, etc., they will only accept it once someone tells them personally. That person could be your mother-in-law, best friend, pastor, neighbor\u2014anyone!\nThe problem is that these same individuals have been listening to the wrong voices. Instead of taking instruction from those who care about them, they listen to strangers, celebrities, friends, co-workers, and so forth. If everyone listened to just one voice instead of ten different ones, imagine the difference it would make.\nWhenever you hear yourself say, \"That'll work,\" or \"It sounds great!\" think again before accepting whatever information being given at face value. You may find out later that you should've done otherwise. So take everything said by everyone seriously, including yours truly. Remember that no one knows better than YOU which pathway to follow.\n|   \n---|---\nQ: What does it mean when you see two people fighting over money? Is it normal behavior among couples?\nA: When two people fight over money, each thinks he or she deserves more than the other. This type of relationship often involves high levels of contempt between partners. One partner wants his or hers; the other believes he or she already got plenty. As long as both parties remain committed to getting ahead without regard for their spouse, they're likely destined to stay stuck together forever...unless divorce becomes necessary.\nIf either party decides against splitting up then chances increase significantly that eventually conflict will arise due to disagreements regarding finance issues alone. In fact, according to research conducted by Dr. John Gottman, marital discord tends toward becoming worse rather quickly upon reaching certain points along its course. He found that whenever conflicts occur early into marriage relationships tend towards dissolution whereas late stage disputations result in reconciliation.\nSo while some folks consider fights over cash normal amongst married folk, experts agree otherwise. Although occasional tiffs aren't uncommon, prolonged hostility ultimately leads down a dark road filled with anger and resentment. And although money matters can cause friction within families, resolving differences peacefully allows everyone involved to move forward happily ever after.\n|   \n---|---\nQ: What is the purpose of money management software?\nA: Money Management Software helps track expenses accurately and efficiently. With today\u2019s technology advancements, consumers everywhere rely heavily upon computers to store data securely online via cloud services such as Dropbox\u2122 and Google Drive\u2122. These applications allow users access anywhere around town \u2014 even remotely through mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. By keeping tabs on budgets using programs like Quicken\u00ae, Excel\u00ae spreadsheets & QuickBooks Online\u2122 accountants gain insightful insights needed to maximize profits effectively. Furthermore, they provide useful tools allowing business owners optimize operational costs wisely. All told, managing funds responsibly requires diligent attention paid daily throughout every aspect related \u2013 from tracking income sources right down payments made regularly.\n|   \n---|---\nQ: Does credit card debt affect your ability to qualify for mortgage loans?\nA: Credit Card Debt Can Negatively Impact Your Ability To Qualify For Mortgages Loan Applications Are Often Denied Due To High Level Of Outstanding Balances Many People Do Not Realize Just How Much Their Personal Financials Play Into Getting Approved Or Rejected During Underwriting Process Lenders Look At Multiple Factors Before Deciding Whether Individual Meets Criteria Needed Based On Current Situation Most Common Reasons Consumers Find Themselves Unable Secure Funds Through Conventional Bank Programs Are Having Excessively Large Amount Unpaid Bills Alongside Low Ratio Between Monthly Paycheck Size Versus Total Annual Expenditure Budget Set Upwards Priority Over Time Period Spending Limitations Put Place Early Life Stage Goals Should Always Take Precedence Over Future Dreams While Building Foundation Which Supports Family Life Style Movement From Renter To Homeowner Happens Gradually Over Course Years However Some People Fall Short Steps Necessary Transition Points Where Responsibility G",

        "answer_1": "It may well be an excellent addition to a diversified portfolio. Personally though I won't touch it until it's gone through at least one crisis-and-subsequent-regulation cycle. At the top of my mind:\n\n\nWhile some P2P companies are actually P2P, most look a lot like banks. They allow investors to deposit/withdraw money very quickly, while the loans they make are for multiple years. This plus a lack of regulation (and associated capital requirements) makes me nervous.\n\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the companies have 'provision funds' which compensate investors in the case some of their loans default. These funds typically run to a few percentage points of the loans made. This seems like something that will fail spectacularly in bad times, and some companies have strange protocols on what to do when that happens.\n\n\nMany of the companies are looking to seize as much market share as possible, and I suspect this will drive them to silently lower the creditworthiness of their lendees. Look at how the sale of MBS drove banks to give mortgages to people who really shouldn't have had mortgages.\n\n\nHere's a good article that details a lot of the issues:",
        "answer_2": "No.\nHere's why:\nBasically, P2P lending is high risk for the lender and the interest rates demanded reflect that reality.  Additionally, interest rates can be jacked up (oh, you might be promised (\"as much as\") a 10% return, but the actual interest rate could be as high as 20%, which is in payday loan territory).  The main problem with P2P lending is what happens at default.  Usually the organizing company tells you \"sorry, better luck next time, now fuck off and here's how to write it off on your taxes\".  Meanwhile, they go after the debtor over the long term to recover \"their\" money, of which you will never see a dime.  The second failure mode is that they stick their snout into the borrower's cash flow via factoring agreements in the contract at the first missed payment.  They then settle your half of the loan at a below par rate (you were promised \"as much as 10%\", but they report the missed payment, say the borrow is in default and give you 2%... you should just be happy you got your money+2% back... meanwhile they're consistently extracting 7% each month via factoring)."

        "question": "Raising Rents on Inherited Tenants? I own a duplex, and I'm discussing acquiring the one next door with the owner.  My rents are $1,100 for a 2/1 unit and $900 for a 1/1 unit.  The neighboring duplex has exactly the same layout.  The owners inherited the property, and they haven't raised rents in the past decade, from before the neighborhood became desirable.  Currently the rents are $700 for the 2/1 and $550 for the 1/1.  \nIf I end up buying the place, I'd obviously want to get the rents to a market rate.  I've chatted with the tenants, while I was renovating my duplex.  (I actually got the owner's number from one of the tenants.)  They are very nice people, and they've lived there for 12 and 15 years, respectively.  I feel pretty bad for raising rents by 80%, but gradually raising would take forever to get to a market rate.  To my knowledge, there is no specific regulation that dictates how much rent can go up in this area.\nThoughts on how to go about this?",
        "prediction": "  Should I just raise them all at once?\n**Jonathan:** Yes\u2014raise it immediately! Do not wait until you buy the house or even do any work on your new building project. You need to be able to tell everyone what the current rates will be when they come back after their lease ends. Otherwise, if they don't sign another lease, then the old rates still apply. And if you try to negotiate later, some may think you were trying to trick them into signing an unfair deal earlier than expected because \"their\" price wasn't really so low after all. This could create unnecessary tension between you and those who remain as tenants. It also creates more risk that you won't find someone else willing to pay that amount since now it seems like too good a bargain to pass up. So either way you lose out financially here unless things change drastically overnight regarding supply versus demand within these particular units. If neither happens right away though, make sure everything stays clean & tidy inside each space; otherwise potential future customers might smell something funky upon arrival which makes me wonder why anyone bothered moving in anyway...\nQ: **How Much Can Rent Go Up When Taking Over an Existing Lease?**\nWe recently took over a house we had been renting for several months already. We have done our best to keep costs down during this time period by doing most repairs ourselves rather than hire contractors whenever possible - however due to lack of funds we couldn\u2019t afford major improvements such as replacing carpet flooring etc.. Now that ownership has changed hands completely, does anything prevent us from increasing monthly rent prices significantly higher than previous levels? Or should we stick close enough where both parties agree mutually beneficial terms prior making final decision together? Thankfully none of tenant base complained loudly against proposed changes \u2013 although many did grumble privately behind closed doors\u2026\n**Mike:** Hi there! Congratulations on taking over this great piece of real estate. As far as I know, nothing prevents you from increasing rent prices significantly above existing levels. However, you must first obtain permission from your landlord through a written agreement signed by both parties before making any changes. This ensures that both sides understand what they expect going forward--and helps avoid misunderstandings later on down the road if issues arise unexpectedly. Without proper documentation detailing agreed-upon terms including payment amounts and frequency schedules, disputes could easily occur leading towards litigation costing thousands dollars instead of saving money over long run term investments made wisely today.

        "prediction": "\nI have been in a situation where I was forced to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and then had my wages garnished. Afterwards, my credit score dropped significantly (as expected) but my employer also took a hit as well because they were required by law to report me filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy which shows up on their record when you apply for other jobs. This caused them some problems with hiring new employees afterward since many people don\u2019t want anything related at all with someone who has declared themselves insolvent! So even though there may not be any financial repercussions from being unable pay back debts due poor planning or misfortune \u2013 things like these still happen sometimes regardless whether we choose ourselves or not; however these types of situations should always try avoid happening again if possible so take heed everyone!!\nIf your business fails, you are personally liable for its debts unless an LLC shields owners from personal responsibility.*\n*This article uses information about corporations instead of sole proprietorships. However, most states allow single-member limited liability companies without separate tax returns while others require multiple memberships per state rules regarding ownership structures within each type of entity.* If one member leaves another joins before forming another entity together outside what was previously done under previous laws governing such matters.* In addition there will likely exist differences between various jurisdictions over time given changing circumstances involving both local governments as well national ones too depending upon individual factors involved herein which could include location geography etcetera\u2026\nThe \u201cowner\u201d of a company can lose everything including his/her house, car, clothes and family. The only way around this would be through bankruptcy protection but even then you might still owe money towards repayment plans set forth during court proceedings depending on how much cash flow comes into your household monthly versus outgoing expenses associated with running said enterprise(ies).\nInsolvencies occur frequently among small firms\u2014and more often than ever before according to recent research conducted jointly by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter Jr., University College London economist Raghuram Rajan, and Stanford Graduate School Of Management dean Jeffrey Pfeffer III. They found that nearly half of American entrepreneurs face insolvency every year\u2013which means either selling off assets or closing down entirely due largely because customers aren\u2019t buying enough products anymore thanks primarily because consumers now prefer cheaper alternatives online rather than going directly inside brick & mortar shops located right next door.\u201d\nWhat happens when a company files for bankruptcy depends on several factors, including the size and complexity of the organization itself as well as external forces beyond anyone's control - such as economic conditions or political instabilities abroad. For example: A large multinational firm may find itself struggling financially due to global competition while smaller startups tend not get caught up in similar issues until later stages when growth slows considerably (if at all), leading them eventually collapse altogether despite having strong initial fundamentals behind them initially.[1]\nWhen a person becomes ill, they typically seek medical care. But when an entire country falls victim to disease or natural disaster, doctors must step in to help those affected. That\u2019s exactly what happened last week when Hurricane Harvey made landfall along Texas coastline causing massive flooding across Houston area leaving thousands homeless without access clean water supply food shelter clothing medicine etc.;[2][3].\nAs soon as word got out about what was happening locally authorities immediately mobilized resources from surrounding communities bringing supplies relief workers volunteering hours away just days following event\u2019s occurrence \u2014 something unprecedented anywhere else worldwide except maybe Japan post Fukushima nuclear meltdown.[4]",
        "answer_1": "It depends.  most of the time the owner is separate from the company so their personal belongings aren't subject to the bankruptcy.  In some cases an owner of a business won't do this.\nExample.  You make cupcakes.  You buy a little store, hire 2 people to help and sell cupcakes out of that store.  You probably had to take out a loan to get that store, maybe cupcakes aren't selling great and you can't keep up on your employee's paychecks.  Eventually the business just isn't making enough money and you can't afford the electric bill (can't keep the lights on) and close the business.\nWhat about all that money you owe?  Maybe a few months on utilities.  Maybe rent/mortgage payments for the property, maybe the last paycheck for employees?  Well you are on the hook for all of that, and can't afford it so you declare bankruptcy.  you couldn't afford it so you just tell everyone \"I don't have the money to pay you\" and all (well, most) of your debt is forgiven.  You have to pay what you can but certain things you own are protected (your home almost always, often a car ect ect).\nNow if you make cupcakes and decide to open a cupcake store you could make Cupcakes LLC or Cupcakes INC.  Then the company you created would buy/rent the store, would pay your employees and bills.  And if the company ran out of money and declared bankruptcy, your bank account is safe because you didn't declare bankruptcy, the company did.\nIn the first example you own the ingredients, you own the store, you own the equipment.  In the second example you own Cupcakes LLC, but Cupcakes LLC is what owns the ingredients/store/equipment.",

He makes a few points in his article that stand out to me. One point is that he didn't try to save enough to cover ALL expenses during those first couple of years. Instead he lived cheap and worked hard. This meant that he spent less than he earned each month. In addition he saved ~$1K extra each month and invested it all (which allowed him to achieve Financial Independence). After reading this article I think I may need to reconsider where I am saving vs investing. I currently put away anything left over into savings accounts, but maybe I should consider putting everything aside except living costs. I guess that means I will probably spend a little bit less. Either way it seems like a better strategy overall.\nAnother interesting thing he mentions is that he quit his job at 33 and went back to school. That sounds like something I could potentially do myself as well.\nThanks for posting that link! Interesting story.\nA few comments / questions based upon the details provided:\nHe says he bought 4 properties between ages 22-27. That's impressive considering most people won't buy real estate until age 30+, let alone four different ones! How did he manage financially? Was he still contributing to TFSAs? RESPs? What kind of income streams existed outside of salary? Did he contribute significantly to the CPP program? Would love to hear more detail about these purchases, especially given how young he was when making them.\nHis primary residence appears to be worth $800K today. If true, why does he continue to own it? Why doesn't he sell it and move somewhere cheaper? Does he intend to pass it onto family members eventually? Or perhaps he wants to leave it vacant to generate additional cash flow?\nWas he able to access the equity in his homes to fund his other projects? i.e., mortgages >$1 million?\nHow long ago was he able to stop earning income entirely and start receiving pension benefits?",

My name is Sean and I am in a bit of a crisis. If I want to go to my 1 college choice (which is already pretty much off the table) I'd have to put in $5,000 by August just for my first year. Even if I don't go to that school, I'd likely need a similar amount of money because my parents are already paying for my older sister's college.

        "prediction": "\nMy 2nd job offer has been rescinded due to COVID-19. Now what??!\nMickeyG posted a topic in Job Market\nHey all - So here\u2019s how things stand: I accepted two offers over Christmas break; one at a large firm with several offices across the country, and one at a boutique litigation shop focused on federal court work. Both were excellent opportunities with great people who seemed genuinely interested in having me join their team. As such, after a few days deliberating between the two, I chose the boutique firm. They offered me more money than the other firm, which I thought was fair given we had discussed compensation prior to making any decisions. However, since accepting, there have been some changes within the office that have caused me to question whether or not taking the role makes sense anymore. Firstly, the partner I was hired under left earlier this week. This isn\u2019t necessarily bad news\u2014the new partners seem like good folks whom I could learn a lot from. But secondarily, my boss also announced his departure shortly afterwards, and the remaining staff will be moving into different positions around the office starting in April. All of these developments came about rather suddenly and unexpectedly. It seems as though no one saw them coming either, including myself. In addition to this change, there has also been a substantial reduction in hours available to associates overall, especially those who aren\u2019t working remotely during the pandemic. I understand why these measures must be taken right now, but it still feels somewhat discouraging knowing that even if everything goes according to plan and I stay through the remainder of my clerkship term, I may face fewer billable hours down the road than initially anticipated. Lastly, while I know this shouldn\u2019t sway my decision too heavily considering the circumstances, our office recently lost three lawyers who had previously worked together elsewhere before joining us in recent years. Two of them departed within weeks of each other late last fall despite having fairly long tenures at our firm compared to most others. These losses occurred alongside many layoffs throughout larger firms nationwide (including my former employer), further compounding my concerns regarding stability among small practices during times of economic uncertainty. At least one lawyer remains active despite leaving less than six months ago; however, she does not appear happy nor satisfied with her situation either judging by various comments made online over recent months concerning dissatisfaction with management styles along with general discontentment towards certain policies instituted following Covid restrictions beginning mid-year 2020...\nJob Offer Withdrawn Due To Pandemic / New Offer Withdrawal\nI hope everyone is doing okay amidst all of this chaos.

Investors should always strive to get as close to the market return as possible while taking less risk than holding all equities in their investment mix. Bonds can provide diversification from equity risks because it has historically had low correlation with stock returns (see https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlationcoefficient.asp) which means when one asset class goes down another will likely go up and vice versa. However, this benefit comes at cost of lower expected returns due to interest rates being so much lower than historical average rate of inflation plus dividend yield on common stocks. So unless someone wants very little exposure towards riskier assets like small cap value then it may make sense to include some allocation toward high quality fixed income instruments since these tend offer more consistent returns through good times and bad. But again, most people don\u2019t need additional protection against losses during periods where everything crashes together; instead they just need something stable enough keep pace with rising costs without losing too much ground relative peers.\nPost by Jags4186 \u00bb Fri Mar 01, 2019 3:14 am\nA few things here... first off let me say thank you for responding and helping me learn about this stuff!! Secondly I do understand the benefits of including bonds into our overall portfolio but I guess what I was trying to figure out is what type of bonds we were talking about here. For example when looking at Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares, its expense ratio is.05% vs iShare Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF which charges 0.1%. That seems like quite a difference in fees alone especially considering the two fund categories look identical except for maturity dates. What are those differences between these types of bonds exactly? Is it simply the duration length? Also does this mean that shorter term bonds will generally charge higher fees? And finally why is total US Aggregate Bond index fund better suited for us given our situation rather than short term corporates etc.. If the answer is simple please excuse my ignorant questions haha thanks again!!",
        "answer_1": "High credit quality bonds dont have nearly as much donwside (potential loss in nominal value) than stocks, and at the same time provide a promised, 'fixed' coupon at a certain price. (hence the name fixed income investments). \nThe appeal of adding bonds to your portfolio is providing a (lower) relatively stable income that is not highly correlated with the gains generated from stocks (it can be for periods of time, like the 2010-2012 recovery bull-market for the US).  \nThe end result is that the overall portfolio has now achieved \na) a shorter downfall potential in the event of an overall market downturn and \nb) a higher risk-adjusted return, by reducing the correlations between assets and moving the portfolio closeer to being an \"efficient portofolio\" in the sense that it provides the highest return for each unit of risk assumed (traditional finance uses volatility as a proxy for this, not a perfect choice but that's a whole different topic)\nWhat makes a bond good/attracctive? In short, a bond is a credit promise, you want the highest yield, with the lowest level of risk, this is where credit analysis comes in. Bonds are by far the largest asset class when you consider the many types Gov't + Corporate bonds that exist, but in order to keep this short, you want high credit quality (ability to make timely promised payments in terms agreed) and higher yeild. \nNaturally this an inverse relationship in which bond traders (including computers using HFT) are looking for value by buying 'cheap' bonds, most commonly used metric would be the spread relative to its credit rating, which is a measure of credit quality given by he ratings agencies. The spread would be the distance in percentage bassis points that a particular bond you're looking into trades from their peers, so, assuming everything else is the same among the peer group, you're looking for the higher spread (highest yielding bond). The peer group is usually based on credit rating.  Note that the natural relationship is that the lower the rating, the higher the yeild. \nBonds are a whole particular universe and a larger chapter of finance. [It is definetely worth taking up a look, and this could be a good place to start to read about credit quality, credit ratings, interest rate risk and spreads.]( \nAs for ETFs, depending on the riskiness of bonds you seek for your portfolio, you could use a variety of things. Vanguard's BLV tracks the performance of the Barclays U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index. \nAdding bond exposure is also a good way to 'anchor' your portfolio or parking some cash, though keep in mind the main risks all bond face are interest rate risks, as their yields are worth less once the risk free rate rises, and hence they're expected to lose value once/when the FED raises rates. \nThe main thing you should take away from this is that it is almost always a good idea to add at least SOME bonds to your portoflio to anchor your portfolio, and improve its risk adjusted return by providing a steadier base and relatively lower, abut also steadier income than stocks. \nYou can find [tons of bond ETF that are long/short on different typees of bonds here](  It will mostly be a matter of how much to add to it, and what level of risk you want in your bonds. \nThe old adage (not very scientific butt provides a ballpark figure) is to have a portoflio mix of (100%- AGE%) in stocks and the rest in bonds, e.g if you're 30, that would be 70% stocks, 30% bonds. I hope this helps as a start. Good luck with your reading!",
        "answer_2": "Current teaching is to consider all income streams when calculating asset mix, ie, both your human and financial capital. If you work a job that pays a salary without much fluctuation, or in other words, acts like a fixed income investment, then you're safe to be 100% stocks. For example, if you're a 25 year old accountant who gets paid the same salary each year, that fixed income stream for the next 35 years discounted to present value is far larger than any sum of money you could invest today. So you are already 99% weighted to fixed income, so feel free to put it all in stocks. Its later down the road when you save up half a million dollars that the weights start to change.\nHowever if you work a job that has pay more correlated with the market, like an investment banker, you're better off putting a good chunk of money in bonds, because you already have equity capital market exposure in your salary/bonus pay.\nNote: This assumes a lot of things, not to be taken completely at face value, as each persons' finances are unique."

If anything has been given to you during her lifetime then it stays hers until she dies; after that they become yours unless someone else says otherwise. So everything she bought herself becomes yours automatically.\nAs regards selling things like cars, houses etc., you don't actually 'own them'. You rent/borrow them from whoever does own them! So what happens depends upon how the contract works. Some people buy their homes outright but many take loans against them. The same applies to cars. Your mother took a loan against her car when she bought it and paid instalments towards its cost every month. When she stopped making those payments, the lender repossessed it because he wanted his money back. He sold it to raise funds to cover part of the sum owed him and pocketed whatever profit remained. That means the lenders still technically own the vehicle and they can re-possess it again whenever they want. But they won't bother trying to get hold of it until they feel sure they will make more than they spent on buying it back off you. They may wait several years. Meanwhile, you have free rein to drive it wherever you please without fear of getting into trouble. However...you must never forget that you haven't paid off the full value of the loan yet, nor did your mother leave enough cash behind to pay the rest either. This leaves you with one option open - try to find another person willing to give you an even bigger loan to repay the old one and continue paying interest on top of that.\nIf you cannot manage to arrange such a deal then eventually the lending institution WILL come knocking on your door demanding payment. As long as you keep finding ways of stalling them somehow though, you might just hang onto possession of the car for longer than expected.",

What should I do now to avoid all the contact between him and my tenant as well as me.  I hate it when my tenant got disturbed by him. I don\u2019t mind if he talked to me through his agent.\nOne more thing is his name is not the seller on the contract because the sellers name on the contract is oxox (ext).

The 529 Plan simply becomes another type of \"account\" in your portfolio and all trades are done through them as well. They keep track of which funds were purchased from each particular fund company. It doesn't matter whether it was purchased directly through the broker/dealer like Fidelity or via a mutual fund company such as Vanguard. In either case, they will see that the purchase came out of one of your accounts at those companies so no need to worry!

If it did, it might require reporting to the government for tax purposes.

I just graduated college with a bachelor\u2019s degree this past year and am working my first job in my field making around $40k.\nThis past weekend my parents visited me and told me the news.

        "prediction": "Thanks!\nsubmitted by Dramatic_Panda3795 to personalfinance [link] [comments]\nHow does this work - Ethereum transaction fees / Gas\nI am currently working through some examples from the ethereum documentation which are intended to help people understand what gas means etc.\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/blob/master/pages/gas.md#how-does-this-work---a-simple-example\nIt says: \"In our example we have two accounts A & B.\" So there seems to be one sender address (A) and one receiver address (B), each with their own balance before sending any funds. The total amount sent between these addresses has been set so that the fee (the gas price * the number of transactions processed) can cover the cost of processing both transactions. How exactly do you calculate the fee then? Do you multiply the gas price by the sum of the transfer amounts? That would seem like a very expensive way of doing things since the minimum required fee could be quite high depending on how many transfers were being made. Is there something else going on here? Or perhaps they mean the gas price needs to match the value of the transferred amount? What happens though if the gas price increases after the first transaction was submitted? Doesn't that make it more likely that future transactions might fail due to insufficient funding? Also, why does the second transaction get a different result compared to the first? It looks like the fee is calculated using the same method regardless.\nIs anyone able to explain further please? Thanks :)\nEdit: To clarify, let's say I want to send $10 worth of tokens from one address to another. If the gas limit is set too low then only part of the token transfer gets completed successfully and the rest fails. Increasing the gas limit makes sure all of the tokens end up where they belong without failure, but also raises the risk that the entire transaction won't fit into the blockchain within its time period. This is because the higher the gas limit, the larger the chance that the miner will spend less time processing your transaction. The fee still remains fixed however, based solely on the initial transaction value rather than the actual gas consumed during the execution process.\nThe question I asked above relates specifically to the calculation of the 'fee'. For instance, if the gas limit is set to 60000 and the transaction costs $8 in gas fees then the gas used must be somewhere around 60000 x ($8 / 8 = $1). But it turns out that this doesn't necessarily hold true either; see below:\nLet us assume that the gas limit is set to 60000 and the transaction requires about half this amount i.e., ~$30 in gas fees. Then we know that the actual usage of gas will fall somewhere between 60000 x ($30/$8= $3.75) and 60000 x ($30/$8*2=$15). However, the actual use may actually lie anywhere between those numbers as well. For example, suppose we increase the gas limit to 120000. Now assuming again that the transaction uses roughly equal parts of each unit available (i.e., 60000 units of 1st type + 60000 units of 2nd type), then this gives us four possible combinations: {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)} and {(2,2)}. Of course, this assumes that all four options contain enough gas units such that none exceed their maximum capacity e.g., 60000+60000+60000+60000!= 60000^2.\nAnother possibility exists whereby we consider cases involving unequal shares between types. Let us imagine now that the gas limit equals 60000 while the amount spent falls short of meeting demand by approximately twice this figure (i.e., 30000 units). Then we have six possibilities including those listed previously plus three new ones namely: [(1,2),(2,2)] and [(3,1)]. These last three scenarios represent situations where fewer units exist per category than necessary thus resulting in lower utilization rates overall. On top of this, note that increasing the gas limit beyond 60000 reduces potential savings significantly relative to maintaining current levels. Hence, it appears unlikely that developers would ever opt against setting appropriate limits given today\u2019s technology constraints.\nFinally, it becomes clear why some users report seeing unexpected charges despite following",
        "answer_1": "\nShould I start saving for a down payment for a house or squirreling it in a Roth IRA?\n\n10 to 20 years is a long time away and the tax laws may change. At the moment, however, you may withdraw up to $10,000 from your IRA for a down payment on a home. This is for \"first-time home buyers,\" which is a loose term that actually means \"anyone who has not owned a home in the last 2 years.\"\n[Source]( \n\nShould I even touch the Roth for anything other than retirement?\n\nA Roth IRA is an amazingly versatile savings vehicle. Because your contributions are post-tax, you can withdraw the entirety of your contributions at any time, without condition, tax-free. If you put $5,000 in your Roth IRA this month, you're free to pull out $5,000 next month without consequence.\nYou may not, however, pull out any earnings from your Roth IRA until you reach retirement age (59 1/2)^1. Still, it's a great deal: tax-free growth and the option to use the principal as an additional emergency fund. It should probably not be used as your main emergency fund, because your Roth investments are likely to be riskier than cash holdings.\n[Source]( \n\nIf not, how should I save for a large expense that's at least 10 years down the line but with no certainty as to when it will happen?\n\nIf you already have a 6 month emergency fund, I see no reason not to invest your \"downpayment\" into a Roth IRA. Especially because your career may increase your income down the line and make you ineligible for a Roth, it's good to open one early in your career. I get the impression you're starting out since you are uncertain if you'll be settling down or purchasing a property in the near future.\nI think Roth is the best option, but if you'd rather not, you could always look into [laddering CDs]( ^2 or high interest checking accounts.\nI have a 3% high interest checking account and just opened another 4% interest checking account. You have to meet certain requirements, such as a minimum number of debit transactions each month. Google \"high interest checking\" to search for an account you can apply to, either in your local city/state or online.\nBest of luck, hope that helps.\n1: Except certain special situations, such as the first-time home buyer situation, as stated explicitly by commenters below.\n2: Unfortunately, CD interest rates have dropped significantly since this article came out. Rates are hovering around 1% and change. The basic methodology is still sound, however.",

        "question": "Broke girl problems I (f17) started working at my first job about 6 months ago. I have about $1200 saved up and was wondering if anybody had any advice on how and where to invest it to make more money, or any ideas on how I could save money quicker and better:)",
        "prediction": "\nI've been saving for a house since i was like 8 years old but now that im an adult its really hard because of bills etc...\nWhat would be the best way to go? Should I buy stocks online with my credit card so they can help me build good credit? Or should i just keep putting it in a savings account until i need it for something big? Any suggestions are appreciated! Thanks guys :)\nsubmitted by ItsNotMyFaultImHuman to personalfinance [link] [comments]",
        "answer_1": "Since this is the first $1200 you have saved up, you probably don't want to invest it in the stock market. Instead, you want to use it as your emergency fund.\nYou describe yourself as a \"broke girl\", but you're not anymore! Broke people live paycheck to paycheck. They make money, and then spend it immediately. They're close to being broke again by the time they get their next paycheck.\nTake that $1200 and promise yourself that you will NEVER live paycheck to paycheck. Always have enough to be one paycheck ahead. And then make it two paychecks ahead. Eventually you want to get to the point where you are about 3 months ahead.\nOnce you have that 3 month buffer, you can start investing money (probably in a Roth IRA, using a target date fund or total market index funds). If you work for a company with a 401k, you'll want to contribute enough to get the full company match. But right now focus on building that buffer.\nThe reason for this buffer is that life is complicated. Unexpected things happen. Your car breaks down. Your pet gets sick. For someone who lives paycheck to paycheck, any unexpected bill is a disaster. But for you, it's not an disaster anymore! You just take your savings and pay off the unexpected bill. Think of your emergency fund as your superpower. You become stronger, tougher, and more resilient than people who live paycheck to paycheck. \nI'm not sure if you can open your own bank accounts at 17, but once you turn 18, you'll want to keep most of your emergency fund in a savings account that pays you around 2% interest or more. (Lots of online banks like Ally and Discover have good interest rates. But the megabanks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo will rip you off by paying you 0.1% interest or less).",

        "question": "No job,No degree, No car, barely able to afford rent and I have a tax refund of $3600 coming. I need advice on how to turn my life around. I'm a 21 year old female, living with my 22 year old girlfriend in a 2 BR at $900 a month. We originally had another couple living with us, but they turned out to be a nightmare and left 2 months into the lease. Right after they left I lost my job because of a minor injury (I had a box fall on my foot), I had 7 days to have a doctor sign a form or else I was considered a liability. None of the urgent care centers would sign and my Primary Care couldn't see me till 20 days after. I receive $733 a month from disability to pay for rent.\nMy S/O lost her job a month later due to the same shitty company practices and couldn't get anyone to sign either. This was her income too. At the time we were both making $2800 a month combined but it was only for 2 months. We had to exhaust our savings in medical care from trying to find someone to sign our Return to Work documents and rent because of our roommates leaving.\n\nWe are desperately trying to find another roommate.\nWe canceled our house phone, and internet (I use a hotspot now)\n\nWe are looking for jobs at temp agencies and anywhere we can find.Unfortunately I live in a state with a high unemployment and high cost of living. And it's getting unlikely that I'll get a job in the next few months.\n\n\nI'm looking into getting my license to extend the job search.\n\n\nSo, what is your advice on what to do with this refund? After next months rent, I have $3400 left over and I plan on saving it, but I need to know what would be the best option for me as far as increasing it.\nEDIT: We are hopefully planning to take our former roommates to small claims, and as someone suggested to me before in this subreddit, I sent a demand letter. Originally they said they'd settle the $4500 out of court, however they sent me a letter saying they weren't going to pay unless we filed it in court. I made the mistake of paying my rent by depositing through my landlord's bank, and lost all the receipts. I do have bank statements showing that I withdrew $900 on the 1st of each month but I'm not sure how that'll hold up.

There is a program to forgive student loans after 25 years of regular IBR (income-based repayments) payments, but you need to make sure she's fully informed.\n\nOnly federal student loans will be forgiven. Any private student loans she has are not eligible.\nWhen the loans are discharged, she will get a tax bill. The discharge of debt is considered income under the tax code. If she's currently paying less than the interest accumulating, this could end up being a very significant bill.\nPresumably she's on IBR, which means as her income rises, the amount she's required to pay will also rise.\nMarriage will affect her payment amounts if you file your taxes jointly. The IBR amount will be recalculated based on your joint income. If you marry but file taxes separately, the amount will continue to be based on her income alone.\n",

Banks seek to serve a wider range of clients and build more sophisticated products and services to serve them.\nIt depends on what you're looking for and what options are available to you locally.\nThey both exist because they both have pros and cons.",
        "answer_2": "This is from my own very limited experience, comparing my wife's credit union and the major regional bank where I have my deposit account.\n\nMy bank has a much better online platform than her credit union.  The credit union actually uses a third party site just to offer PDFs of account statements.  My bank's site can initiate ACH transfers, pay bills online, and much more.  My wife's credit union cannot.\nHer credit union's loan offerings are much more limited.  Mortgages are capped at $350,000.  (That's an irrelevant restriction for us because in our location, that's enough for plenty of house, but it would be tough in San Francisco.)  In addition, they do not offer points on mortgages or many other forms of loan product flexibility.  But the rates are pretty reasonable and they don't charge origination fees (in fact, they even ponied up extra cash towards closing costs for our mortgage).\nHer credit union's depositor-service offerings are more limited, too.  They don't even offer an ATM card or credit card.  Getting direct deposit set up was easy enough, but the only way we've ever made an actual withdrawal has been by sending an email to an actual human being at the credit union to authorize the transfer, which was verified by a return phone call placed to us.  No online funds transfers, no actual branches where one can walk in and withdraw money, and like I said, no debit or credit cards.  I don't even think they offer checks.  We certainly don't have any.\nThe current dividend on shares (equivalent of interest) at the credit union is 0.75%.  At my bank, it's 0.25%.  Of course, both of those are lousy, that's just what interest rates are like right now.  But the combination of the fact that (a) it's easy to get money into the credit union (many people at the Fortune 500 company it's associated with simply have a portion of their paychecks automatically deposited there), (b) it's a little bit harder to access once it's there, and (c) it earns at least a little bit more interest while it's there, means that she and most of her coworkers use the credit union as a savings account or a place to put some money away little by little to build up for major purchases, while using a more traditional bank for everyday cash management needs.\nHer credit union largely ignored some black marks on her credit history when she applied for a loan.  We were denied for a mortgage loan by two local banks because of her credit.  I don't think her credit union even pulled her score.\nHer credit union approves loans with dramatically less paperwork than traditional banks.  As in, the total volume of forms for our mortgage was four pages.\nHer credit union is dramatically less leveraged than almost any bank I've heard of.  They release their figures monthly, in a newsletter that looks like the local high school newspaper editor did it in his spare time.  In September, they had about $170M in deposits (shares) and $30M in outstanding loans.  Bank executives would probably be on the verge of getting fired if they were so risk-averse.  Usually those numbers will be flipped and more in the commercial banking world.\n\nI'm sure that there are other credit unions that are nothing like my wife's company's, and I'm sure there are plenty of regular for-profit banks out there that have antiquated tech as well.  But those are the differences I've noticed.  And for the record, I'm pretty happy with both my bank and her credit union, and I'm glad that the overall financial landscape in this country is such that there's room for both."

Everyone wants to give Trump credit for making progress on trade negotiations. They want to talk about the positive things he did today regarding Iran. However, the fact remains that nothing has changed since December. Nothing has moved substantively between the U.S. and China. This is still a tit for tat negotiation. There was never any realistic chance that President Xi Jinping was coming home with a big checkbook. He wasn\u2019t giving away his country's future. I think everyone needs to understand that this is still a game of chicken. Yes, the Chinese economy slowed down significantly in Q4. In terms of their GDP growth rate, it came in around 6%. Now, whether that number is accurate or not, the point being made is that they're slowing down dramatically. Their currency dropped precipitously against the dollar. So, this isn\u2019t working. Both sides continue to dig themselves into deeper holes. And ultimately, neither side is willing to make concessions. Therefore, unless both countries decide to blink simultaneously, I don\u2019t see how we avoid further escalation.

I went to my local Honda dealer looking for a car I had already found online. Once I found out it was there, I was pretty much already at the point of being sold on it. It was a Honda Civic 2016 LX with only 36,777 miles and no issues or past accidents for $13,677.\nI got with a representative and we started talking about my car credit. Well, I had absolutely no car credit, since this would be my first financed car, so the guy told me I would have to put a larger amount down on the car. I originally came in with the intention of only putting down $2,000 max out of my $3,580 in savings down on the car. So, when I said $1,500 and the guy asked if I could put $2,000 instead to increase my chances of getting a loan, I was a little discouraged but understanding since I had no credit and I really wanted this deal. The guy then walks to the back to give this information to the banks. After about 20 minutes, he comes back and asks if I could put down $2,500. I start getting a little annoyed at this point, but I agreed none the less. He walks to the back and I wait about another 20 minutes. The guy comes back and, this is when I get really freaked out, he says that the bank is willing to give me a loan, but I would have to put down $3,500. I sat there for a solid minute to think this one out, but I really wanted to get a car to start a new job I've been looking at for a while and I didn't want to die in a junker vehicle, so ultimately I decided to go for it. I was getting my paycheck in a few days anyways and I live with my father, so it didn't seem like too much of a risk. Once I'm signing papers, I end up getting to the part where I see my APR and loan term. This is where my bum is starting to feel a little sore. It was a 6 year loan with a 25% APR. And so now, I have a car that ended up being $25,000 instead of $13,677. \nWith my position right now, I feel like I can manage the payments, but what I'm asking here is: Is there a better way to handle this loan now with the circumstances? Should I try to get a co-signer to lower the APR and payments? If so, could I do it with my current loan, or should I refinance? If I do that, do I refinance now, or in two years?

One I got in October of last year - the other one I've had since April.  The job I've had since April is now offering me full time which comes with a hourly wage almost equal to the first job with a whole ton of awesome benefits as well.  So I definitely want to do that instead of continuing to work 60+ hours a week.\nIn the past I have always used the two-week notice as a professional courtesy.  This job that I want to quit now though - only giving a two-week notice would almost undoubtedly screw them.  I only have 4 other co-workers in my \"department\" and we are split among 3 zones and are all part-time with other jobs.  Zones in this context is just cities and towns in about a 50 mile radius.  One of these zones is solely my responsibility.  I work with clients in my zone who I meet with during my workday.  I have clients booked up with me throughout the next 3 months.\nTo do my job requires me to be certified by the state and involves at least a month of training alone and then some for paperwork, etc.  So me quitting would mean a scramble to hire someone else who would undoubtly need to be trained to get certified before they could even start to take over for me.  I think this could take my employer 2 months or more to do.\nBut I really don't want to keep working this job for all that to happen.  I don't really have any bad feelings for my employer; I'm just in a position to have something better right now.. That is just how it goes.  However, that being said; I'm offered absolutely no benefits from this employer and I believe I am being paid $2-$5/hr less than my co-workers (which would put them at or around $20/hr).  But even if they offered me a good bump in pay I still wouldn't see it as worth it compared to being full time at the other job and having a better work-life balance.\nIf I wasn't so worried about feeling guilty I would just give my two weeks, be done and not worry about leaving them high and dry.  But I'm typically not that type of person.  So I want to give my employer the option of keeping me a little bit longer and instead giving a 1-2 month notice or some sort of staggered leave where they could continually reduce my schedule over a set time period (like 3 months).\nHowever, if I gave them an option like that, I would kinda want them to make it \"worth my while.\"  I just wouldn't have any idea how to bring that up without sounding like an absolute scumbag.\nShould just skip all that and just give them a 2-3 week notice and leave them to figure their own shit out?  Or should I offer to stay longer if they work something out with me?  If so how should I go about brining that up?\nAnd just to be clear- I'm not trying to take advantage of a situation to pry money out of the employer... I would be just as happy if they had someone to replace me and I could just up and quit.\nSorry for the wall of text.",

        "prediction": " Thanks! \u2013 John\nA: Hey, thanks for your question, John. It sounds like you have some good questions on Roth IRAs that we can help answer today. Let me start with what is probably most important first\u2014the tax treatment of both accounts. When it comes to taxes in the U.S., everything boils down to two types of income: ordinary (or nonqualified) and qualified. Ordinary or nonqualified income refers to anything that isn't specifically excluded from being considered qualifying income by law. For example, salaries and wages earned through employment are generally treated as ordinary income, while interest earnings and dividends paid out by banks and corporations are usually classed as ordinary income. Qualified income is any type of income that meets specific requirements set forth under federal tax laws governing retirement plans. This includes contributions made directly into traditional individual retirement arrangements (IRAs), which provide significant benefits over time due primarily because they allow individuals who make regular contributions throughout their working years access up front deductions when filing returns at year end without paying any current tax liability until withdrawals begin later during life after reaching age fifty nine point five. Investors may also take advantage of other features offered within these vehicles including penalty free distributions prior to turning seventy two years old along with no required minimum distribution rules once retired beginning at age seventy two if desired but not mandatory unless otherwise stated explicitly elsewhere herein regarding said topic matter contained above mentioned previously earlier written paragraph wise referenced further below next sentence quoted verbatim exact word for word taken straight off page six hundred twenty four section eight subsection A paragraph three clause B line item C bullet point one decimal point four seven two percent multiplied times zero divided evenly across all available funds invested equally distributed proportionately weighted according given percentage shareholdings calculated based upon total number shares held currently owned versus potential future ownership stake acquired going forward moving forward continuously forevermore always never ending eternity everlasting timelessness infinity beyond measure boundless unlimited infinite limitless infiniteness etcetera ad nauseam infinitely ad infinitum ad infinitem etcetera etcetera\u2026\nQ: How much does it cost to open and maintain a Roth IRA account?\nA: The cost varies depending on where you live; however, many brokerage firms now charge $0 commission fees for opening/closing accounts so this shouldn\u2019t be too big of an issue anymore since people typically don't need physical locations anyway. If you do decide go ahead setting yourself up shop somewhere local though remember those additional charges could add up quickly especially considering how often folks tend move houses these days - sometimes multiple times per week!.

You should end up with roughly equal amounts going into those accounts each year once everything gets paid off.

        "answer_1": "It works like any other investment account where you can sell the investments and withdraw the money into your bank account at any time (just pay income taxes on any traditional 401k assets withdrawn).\nHow long / how much you withdrew is totally dependent on the balance of your 401k. If you have only saved $100 in there then you can only withdraw $100. Or you can probably set up automatic withdrawals, or whatever else you want.\nThere are required minimum distributions with traditional 401ks, which requires once you are 70.5 years old you must withdraw a certain percentage of the balance in a given year, that percentage increasing every year. But you can always withdraw more than that amount, assuming you have the funds to do so.\nI think the 4% safe withdrawal rate is a pretty good strategy, where if you were invested 50% stocks 50% bonds you could theoretically withdraw 4% of the account balance every year (adjusting for inflation each year) for at least 30 years without running out of money.",
        "answer_2": "The rules for what you can do with a 401k in retirement depend on your company's plan.  Some will let you set up periodic withdrawals, some let you take out money at any random time and amount you want.  Others only let you take a single post-retirement withdrawal, of the entire balance (In which case, you should roll it into an IRA).  They can have fees for setting up periodic plans, or not, or have fees for every single withdrawal.  \nRolling into an IRA is common, because then you can shop around for one you like, rather than having to go with the rules your former employer set."

        "answer_1": "Your question is the root of a concept known as the safe withdrawal rate (SWR). This is the rate at which you can draw from the interest on your assets without decreasing the principle. For many, a SWR is 4%, with a more conservative estimate being around 3%. As such, assets of $1.25M would support a 4% withdrawal rate of $50k for the first year, increasing with inflation. That last bit is important. There is an assumption that your assets will grow by at least 4% after inflation, meaning you can take out more than $50k after the first year, and so on, to keep up with inflation and keep your real spending power constant.\nThe last bit I wanted to say is about \"in the bank.\" These assets would need to be invested in a combination of stocks/bonds in order for the interest to be enough to support this kind of income. If you put it in a bank at 0.05% interest you will rapidly draw down the principle and go broke.",

There are many ways you can manage the money you borrowed while still living comfortably: Live at home during college. If possible, live at home instead of going away to college so you won't have as much expenses like rent payments every month which will help reduce how much interest accrues over time..

It can lower your payment amount, making them easier to afford. However, if you use Personal Loans for Student Debt Relief purposes rather than traditional methods like refinancing through banks and private companies alike (such as SoFi), make sure that their terms aren't worse than those offered elsewhere -- otherwise why bother? For example: If someone else offers better rates than yours currently are but requires higher fees than usual ($50-$250+) due either directly related issues (like income verification process) or indirectly caused ones (such as having no co signer). In conclusion here--if anyone asks themselves \"Should I apply?\" Then answer yes!!!!! Just remember though:\"Be careful.\"\nCan I consolidate federal and private student loans into one new loan?\nYes, you may combine multiple Federal Direct Stafford and PLUS loans into one new loan. This is called consolidating your federal education loans. The resultant single repayment plan allows borrowers to simplify management of these separate accounts while taking advantage of certain benefits provided only after combining several different types into one larger sum total: reduced monthly payments due mainly thanks largely because interest charges remain fixed across all individual components combined within same pool (i.e., there exists no difference between original principal balance owed versus current value).

The other issue is that there are a lot of people who bought trucks/SUVs because they were getting such good deals due to GM\u2019s bankruptcy several years ago. With GM back up and running at full capacity now, those deals aren\u2019t quite so great anymore which means less sales from customers who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have purchased new cars. This also applies to FCA since they had a huge surge in demand after Chrysler went through bankruptcy with lots of \u201cdeep discount\u201d pricing available. As these companies get out of bankruptcy, the prices will go up and we\u2019ll see if consumers still want what was previously offered before the big price cuts.\nFord\u2019s been having some major troubles lately too though, including laying off 7k workers overseas last year: https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/ford-to-cut-jobs-in-europe-and-asia-overhaul-global-operations#gs.BQC09zZTqJR. It sounds like they need to make some drastic changes internally first before worrying about external factors outside of their control.\nAs far as the trade wars, most experts seem to agree that they won\u2019t affect car manufacturers much either way unless something goes terribly wrong. If China decides to impose large tariffs on US auto imports then yes, costs may rise slightly, however if we decide to raise our own import taxes then Chinese automakers might choose to build plants elsewhere instead resulting in no change overall.

We did this for several years while getting ahead on principal repayment, then switched back to regular monthly. Since we were using TD bank at the time, all the details of how much to put towards principal vs. interest were handled automatically; iirc we had to tell them what percentage of principle reduction we desired. This worked very smoothly, though I believe they would have let me adjust things manually after the initial setup if necessary.\nWe didn't see any significant difference in terms of total interest paid between biweekly and standard monthly payment schedules.

It sounds like you might not qualify for such a program due to having too much income coming into your household but it doesn't hurt to ask. The consequences for defaulting on Canadian obligations will only apply to assets located within Canada. Assets outside of Canada won't be touched unless there was fraud involved.\nIf you do go ahead with filing for bankruptcy then yes, it will show up on your credit report which could potentially impact future applications for lines of credit. There may also be tax implications depending on how long ago you filed for bankruptcy. If you haven't yet declared personal insolvency then you should consult with a financial advisor before taking action since there may still be options available to get yourself financially solvent again. Bankruptcies typically stay on your record for six years after which time most lenders stop checking them when evaluating potential borrowers. However, there are exceptions where certain types of accounts remain flagged even longer than normal. For example student loans usually require repayment until age 45 whereas car loans generally expire once paid off completely regardless whether one chooses early termination via refinancing/repossessing vehicle(s), selling asset(s), etcetera; however these instances vary widely based upon state laws governing each specific type of contractual agreement signed between borrower and creditor entity prior signing said document(s)/contract(s).

The downside is that you won't be able to access your funds immediately via ATM withdrawals etc., however you can transfer them directly from this type of account to another.

And yes.\nWhat should I do in the future to ensure this doesn't happen again? Don't try to play hardball over the phone. Go meet face to face and then you will see whether it works out well enough to continue discussions. If you don't get along with someone, you might still end up taking their money if you really need the job, but you won't enjoy yourself while you're making compromises just to keep it. Also, always look for ways to make concession without losing anything important--like being flexible on start date, or having some extra vacation days built into your contract, or whatever else makes sense given the circumstances.\nAnd lastly, don't forget that sometimes things fall apart because the person hiring isn't ready yet either. He could have been looking forward to giving you the job already, until his supervisor reminds him why he shouldn't give away all his best employees. Or he could decide tomorrow morning that he wants to change jobs after all. There's nothing personal going on between you guys, so please don't take it personally.\nposted by John Cohen at 4:28 PM on September 29, 2013 [10 favorites]\nIf I were you, I would accept the second interview and hope for better results. In fact, I would probably tell the interviewer that the previous offer fell through and ask her directly if she thinks the new offer would also fall through if presented to the same party.\nAlso, next time around, find out which recruiter is handling your search and contact that person directly instead of calling HR. That'll save you a lot of trouble and anxiety.\nposted by jon1270 at 4:28 PM on September 29, 2013 [2 favorites]\nThis thread might interest you: Is It Possible To Overnegotiate A Job Offer?.\nIMO, the answer to your question is no -- you weren't wrong to negotiate, but you were definitely wrong to use the word \"requirement\". Your goal in negotiations should never be to show you're willing to walk away, but rather to maximize your chances of winning everything possible within reason. In this case, you made the mistake of saying \"this much or we're done.\"\nNow that you understand what went wrong, let me explain what you can learn from this experience:\nNegotiating via telephone is risky business unless both parties are accustomed to conducting those conversations. Face-to-face communication is far superior since body language provides information that simply cannot be communicated verbally. On top of that, using email allows you to review every sentence carefully prior to hitting send, whereas speaking often leads us to say things we regret immediately afterwards.\nYour desire to secure the job was evident during the conversation, and I suspect you sounded desperate when trying to reach agreement. This is exactly opposite of how you wish to appear during negotiations. As a general rule, the less interested you seem in accepting an offer, the stronger your leverage becomes.\nLastly, remember that the value of a single laboratory technician is dwarfed by the overall cost of operating the entire facility. Unless you're seeking to become an executive level employee sometime soon, there's little chance the loss of a few thousand dollars per year will cause management undue concern. Therefore, once you're offered a starting wage above market rate ($29K), you should assume you've already secured the deal. At that point, all that remains is determining how many additional benefits and perks you can squeeze out of your potential employers.\nAside from the obvious, a couple suggestions:\n* Do NOT mention money",
        "answer_1": "I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way\nSalary negotiations can be very delicate, despite all the hard-ball internet advice - most of which is wrong, or at best appropriate only to unique candidates with very highly sought after skills.  It's possible your description that you were just messing with them abuot $35k in order to get the offer up might have hit a raw nerve.  In general, expressing interest and asking (nicely) for a better salary should have been fine.  Your ask seems fine.  When they come back lower than you asked, your acceptance and positive interest in working there should have also been fine.\nRescinded offers are unusual.  Either they are a terrible company to work with, or your description of your tactics bothered them (this will be someone never happy) or maybe they just found some sucker to work there for $25k.  They won't tell, so you just have to move on and look for another opportunity.\nA company that cannot pay very well and acts so odd about salary negotiations is probably not someone you wanted to work for long term anyway.  Time to move on to other prospects.",
        "answer_2": "I know it's been beat to death, but just to give you some perspective on why you get rejected: If your salary desires do not align with what they can provide, you are a flight risk. Not only that, but asking for more than the average salary when you're fresh and not even skilled enough to be asking for average (let alone +10%), it can reflect poorly upon you. I always suggest negotiating if you think an offer is raw, but be prepared to lose it, and always be realistic. 35k on a 28k offer probably wasn't the best advice."

        "question": "Is rent to own ever a good option? I'm just in the beginning stages of getting all my finances in order, looking ahead to bring a home at some point.  I see a lot of homes  in areas I would love to live in advertising rent to own situations.   It seems too easy to avoid the banks for a year or two while living in the house I'd end up buying.  Is it a good deal or just a scam?",
        "prediction": "\nA: Rent-to-own is an interesting concept that has been around since the early days of civilization when people paid nominal fees (usually grain) to occupy land they did not yet own but intended to buy later. The idea behind this arrangement was to provide protection against squatters who might try and take over your property if you were away from it for any length of time. In modern times, we have evolved into more sophisticated versions such as lease options which allow someone with no money down to enter into contractual agreements whereby he pays monthly rents until enough equity builds up so that he can qualify for conventional financing on his future purchase price. This type of transaction works well provided both parties understand what each expects out of their relationship during its duration. However, there are also many pitfalls associated with these arrangements including potential fraudulent behavior by unscrupulous sellers/landlords seeking quick profits without putting much effort toward maintaining properties properly before entering into deals like these; failure rates due primarily because tenants often fail to save adequate funds needed after paying off debts accrued through years spent living within walls owned by others rather than themselves; etcetera ad infinitum! If done correctly though, then yes indeed - rent-to-own programs certainly CAN be effective ways towards achieving long term goals involving real estate ownership.

        "answer_1": "It's not necessarily a scam, but it's usually more expensive than buying outright. The reason being that many of these transactions do not end up in a sale, so there is more risk of damage to the property and need for repair on the seller's part. The risk and cost associated with that is factored into the cost of the property or financing. ",

Did some research, using a lot of your credit isn't the problem, its using a lot of it then having it on your monthly statement. So even though you have an amount to time to pay it off before it gets interest, don't have more than 50-75 (I say that for your 500 limit specifically and made it on the safe side) dollars on your statement when it comes. I got a cash rewards card with not a lot of restrictions on redemptions and I have been buying EVERYTHING with it. Because I do this for every 50 dollars I spend, I make a payment. So if I go a few days and spend it on nothing but fast food, I wait till the balance hits 50 and send in an online payment. If I buy something online like a nice new widget from newegg for over 50, I pay that off as soon as it shows up on the card. Right now I made a big order from newegg so there's around 300 on it.

B) you want to increase your credit limit faster. Using it a lot and then paying it off fast will show your reliable and you could need a higher credit limit. Why do you want a higher credit limit?

There's nothing wrong with living with my parents, I just wanted to move out to experience living with friends.\n\nIf this is genuinely true, and you're not going into extra unnecessary student debt to afford living on your own, then I would stay living with friends. I moved back in with my parents after college and honestly it was difficult. We get along great but the relationship just feels different once you have lived on your own and trying to figure that out can be challenging. It also can definitely have a negative effect on your social life as a student--this isn't financial but I think it's worth considering nonetheless. The people I rented a house with during my junior and senior years of college are some of the only people I have kept in touch with from that period of my life and living with them taught me a whole lot about life. Even just basic things like dealing with the cable company when the internet goes out, interactions with your landlord, figuring out how to navigate shared spaces with people who aren't just the family you've been with your whole life are all critical skills you'll have to learn at some point. College is a better time to do that than when you're in your first job working long hours and stressed. If you can afford to live outside your parents' house, I think the experience is worth it, but if you're paying rent with student loans you're likely better off moving home.\nThe majority of people on here will tell you to move back home because in pure financial terms, it's the more economical choice. But one thing that this sub is sometimes guilty of is forgetting that your finances aren't the only part of your life. Again, this assumes that you can afford this and aren't going into debt to live on your own, but consider what you want out of your college experience and what memories you're going to look back on.

        "question": "Just took a new job after 10 years, now another company is scouting me. Should I stay or should I go? HELP! Throwaway account just to be safe. Just to make everything easier I will refer to previous employer as PE, current employer CE, possible future employer FE. \n I recently got a new after working at my past job for 10 years.  I work in marketing and my PE wasn't doing very well and I got out right before they shut down.\nI really like my new job and was able to get a bump in salary.  CE seems to be doing really well with plans to greatly increase their workforce over the next two years.  But there are negatives to this new position. It has much less freedom as far as working out of the office and the travel time is about 45 minutes and probably more in the winter. \nAfter my PE closed up shop, the owner of the company, which I had a great relationship with suggested to another company my name as a suggestion for a possible hire.  After a few rounds of interviews FE made me an offer. Now, I have a big decision to make.\nFE made me an offer around 54k with 3 weeks of vacation and HR informed that with bonuses it will be a good deal more than my current salary.  My CE salary is 55k with 3 weeks vacation. From what I can tell the benefit packages are fairly similar. Although, FE has tuition reimbursement and profit sharing.  The FE has direct lines for promotion in many different areas in the company which was pointed out to me during the interview process.  While the CE, although growing, hasn't shown me any visual growth paths thus far.  \nThe FE is only a 15 minute drive and seems to allow some freedom which is huge since my husband and I just had our first child 10 months ago.  However, this company is in the same business as my PE, print and direct mail marketing, which I feel may not be the best industry going forward, and not as fulfilling professionally. My CE deals with cutting edge technology and is growing at a rapid rate. It has been on the INC 5000 list for the past 3 years. (List of fastest growing privately held businesses in the US.)\nBoth jobs seem to have pros and cons and I am I'm at a complete deadlock as to what to do. I also need to tell the FE today. :) HELP!",

        "question": "Why do investors sell properties? In the beginning stages of learning about REI, hoping to purchase my first property within the next year. But one thing that's bugging me that I can't shake, is wondering why investors sell properties.\nMy thinking is that if it was a good enough investment deal, the original owner would keep it for the cash flow. So something has to be amiss, be it impending repairs or maybe projected property value loss etc.\nAny advice/insight?",
        "prediction": " Thanks!\nSometimes people just don\u2019t like dealing with tenants and maintenance issues anymore\u2026..and they have other things on their plate (like raising kids) so they want to get out of real estate all together. Sometimes there are tax reasons to move from a long term holding to short-term flipping. Maybe you have an older person who wants to downsize into smaller housing or a young couple moving up in life and needing more space. There could also be family dynamics where someone passes away and leaves behind a house full of memories. That kinda stuff happens too. It\u2019s not always about profit motive. \u2013 Mike Patterson 3 hours ago",
        "answer_1": "Investing in teal estate is not much different than investing in the stock market. \nWhen thinking about stocks consider that companies can underperform and even go out of business. No stock is risk free. You may buy a stock that has great long term potential as a buy and hold. You may buy other stocks that are in emerging markets and have higher risk.\nThe same connections can be made with real estate. Some properties are great for buy and hold. You may want to keep them indefinitely. They have low risk and a high upside.\nOther properties may he in fluctuating markets. The risk may be higher. You may have stagnant populations and job markets.\nThe other reason is to free up capital and lock in returns. You do not have a real return on investment until you have sold that investment. At the sell the return becomes real and the cash can be invested again.\nYou really do not want to own paid off properties. Part of the leverage on returns is having a payment being made by a tenant. If a tenant is essentially paying your loan payment then you are maximizing the leverage. \nFor example\nYou buy a $100k property for $20k down. Your tenant is paying the loan on the borrowed $80k and you are still getting a profitable return. When that loan is payed off then you are making a return on what may be a $200k property and $200k of your cash instead of $20k of your cash. That is not a great investment especially if the lease payment has not gone up by over 1000% in that time frame.\nWhat you can do is sell the property for $200k and reinvest that $200k return into five more properties worth $200k each with a $40k down payment. You now have $1 mill in properties purchased with $200k and lease payments that are paying down the loans. \nYour tenants can now pay down the loans on those properties until you sell and take real returns. Those real returns can once again be reinvested. ",
        "answer_2": "I work in Commercial Real Estate so I can give you a ton of reasons, but a few major ones:\nEveryone has a different expectation of the return they might make on a property. Just using a random round number, 10% might sound really good to you, but bad for another person. So a lot has to do with expectations of return.\nAlso, maybe this investor needs to sell to pay off another asset, or obligation. You never know at first, which is why the story behind the asset is so important.\nFinally, sometimes sellers aren't sophisticated. Maybe they're not managing the property well because they don't know the market well, what rents are, etc. Or maybe there's a good reason to fix up the asset but they just can't see it. These are just a handful of reasons."

        "answer_1": "One of the perks of REI is utilizing other people\u2019s money (OPM) to leverage your investment.

But it comes at a cost of putting all your money in one basket. If you were going to do buy and hold with cash you might as well just invest in REITs or eREITs.Much better liquidity and no dealing with maintenance or tenants. \nUnless you\u2019re competing with multiple offers and want to be the most attractive one I personally wouldn\u2019t ever go 100% cash.",
        "answer_2": "The first thing I would look at is landlord tenant laws in your city.  If you live in a landlord friendly area it's a much less risky proposition than somewhere like New York for example which is extremely tenant friendly.  I would check out the eviction process, if it's lengthy and complicated I would be very careful.\nI also wouldn't go into it thinking that you are making \"passive income\" owning a rental property because there is a lot that goes into it.

What was the psychological barrier that needed to be broken? \nIs there anyone who has started with thousands and turned it into millions?  ($heff comes to mind).\nThanks!",
        "prediction": "\n##### The Paper Trade\nThe first thing we need to address before getting too deep into discussions about size is whether or not people should actually trade on their own money until they have developed a profitable system. This may seem like an obvious statement; however, many newbies begin trading immediately without developing any sort of edge. They simply jump right in because they want action now. If you were asked if you wanted to fly across country tomorrow morning would you say yes? Of course you wouldn't. You might think you had enough time to prepare yourself for such a trip\u2014but really, you don't unless you're already experienced doing something similar. And yet so often when someone asks us where he can find information on daytrading, one of our replies will include \"go out and start trading.\" This makes no sense. We are suggesting that individuals go ahead and risk large sums of money on things they haven't tested under real market conditions _before_ learning proper techniques. It doesn't matter how good those techniques appear theoretically; once exposed to actual markets, the strategy falls apart quickly due to human error alone. For example, most beginners believe they can buy stocks cheaply using limit orders placed during the opening bell. However, as soon as the bell rings, hundreds of other traders flood onto the exchange floor and create huge imbalances between supply/demand which cause prices to gap away from previous levels. In fact, some gaps occur within seconds of opening bells while others take hours or days depending upon various factors including volatility indices. So why spend countless dollars trying unproven strategies instead of testing them first? Why gamble away hard earned savings when success isn\u2019t guaranteed anyway? Because these same questions apply equally well towards professional investors who place enormous amounts betting against themselves via hedge funds & private equity firms alike. As long ago philosopher George Santayana warned \u201cthose who cannot remember history are condemned to repeat its mistakes.\u201d Unfortunately today more than ever, financial institutions continue down paths fraught wtih danger despite warnings sounded repeatedly over past decades by economists ranging from John Maynard Keynes through Robert Shiller. Yet still banks keep taking risks blindfolded hoping somehow luck favours them rather then skillful application knowledge gained through experience.\n### QUESTION #3\nHow important is discipline to successful option trading?

The results are presented here as \"CAGR\" which is a measure of compound annual growth rate. Note that this does not take into account dividends paid out along the way, but rather just assumes reinvestment at the beginning of each period.\nSo yes, there is something special about these funds\u2014but only because they were created _after_ the crash and they can be used to buy options (which increase your returns even more) instead of stocks themselves! In other words, don't expect miracles unless you get very lucky indeed.\n##### **What Is An Option Contract Anyway?**\nAn option contract allows traders to purchase shares without actually owning them directly. This means that instead of buying low then selling high like most people do when trying to profit off their portfolios; they will sell short first so they can later repurchase back after prices drop below where they bought originally.* By doing this type of transaction repeatedly throughout different markets around world; trading desks become profitable due having access large amount capital while also being able risk less since margin requirements aren't nearly as strict compared traditional forms securities such stocks & bonds etcetera. However despite popular belief among newbies who believe everything else matters except price movement itself \u2013 there isn't anything magical going on here either! Instead what makes leverage work well together lies within mathematics behind every single trade executed across global exchanges day night weekend holiday whatever.. And trust us once understand how works behind scenes soon realize why its becoming increasingly difficult resist temptation taking advantage situation regardless whether person knows exactly what happening next second minute hour month year decade century millennium eternity beyond infinity...\n###\n##### **The Best Way To Use Leveraged Funds**\nThere are two ways to use leverage:\n  1. Buy calls and puts against equities. \n    * Example: You think Apple is going up tomorrow. So you go ahead and buy AAPL Feb call @$35 strike price expiring Friday morning. That gives you 10x leverage on your position (you own $35 worth of AAPL per share). Now imagine if AAPL goes down 5%. Your loss is now limited to $3.50 per share ($35 x 10%). On the flip side, if AAPL doubles in value tomorrow morning, your gain would be $35 multiplied by ten times which comes out to $350 per share (that's a 1000% return!) Of course things rarely happen perfectly according plan so always keep stop losses nearby too protect yourself should unexpected events occur during trading session(s).\n    2. Short stocks via put spreads / straddles combined with covered calls written against underlying asset class e g gold miner XAUUSDJPYCHFetc etc....\n*Note : These strategies involve significant risks including potential total loss of principal deposited!!! Do Not Trade Unless Understand Risk Management Procedures!!!!\n\n###\n##### **How To Find Good Trades With High Potential Return**\nWhen looking for trades with high potential return, consider both the probability of success and the magnitude of reward relative to risk taken. Here are three tips that may help improve odds:\n1. Look for situations where there has been recent volatility followed by consolidation periods lasting several weeks or months; these provide opportunities for sudden breakouts above previous resistance levels leading higher towards target objectives set forth earlier in advance prior knowledge gained experience gained expertise developed acquired accumulated built upon achieved obtained attained accomplished completed finished fulfilled realized reached succeeded won conquered defeated overcome vanquished subdued quelled suppressed squashed stampeded crushed annihilated destroyed eradicated wiped clean eliminated removed excised aborted terminated cut off chopped chop hack saw chainsaw blender pulpizer grinder disposal unit incinerator crematorium funeral pyre flaming torch burning fire blazing inferno fierce conflagration raging wildfire intense combustion rapid oxidization violent reaction explosive detonating impl",
        "answer_1": "Leverage increases sequence risks. So the \"I can't retire, stock market is down\" problem becomes much greater.\nThe only valid use of leveraged funds I've seen is somebody proposed taking a 60:40 fund and using leverage to bring the expected return back to the level of a 100:0 fund. That gives you much more stable returns.",
        "answer_2": "In very short, the leverage amplifies the losses too, not just the gains. Since these structured funds have to renew their future contracts all the time (most daily, monthly is the rare max), they realize losses frequently. It's not just a big drawdown that makes these funds lose, but volatility can eat the capital pretty fast.\nAll that said, a leveraged ETF will work well for you if the asset it tracks moves in the desired direction with low volatility during the time interval in question. The longer this interval, the more likely one of the two conditions won't be met (direction and low volatility).\nSee also [Investopedia]( "

I am in my mid-twenties, and I have $24500 in debt: $8500 on a credit card (I've been a young idiot, I know), and $16000 in student loans (and I have already gone through a consolidation).  I have recently committed to paying $300 (just less than double the minimum payment) towards my credit card every month (and I no longer use it at all), and I pay $200 towards my student loans every month (which currently sits at a $0 balance, with no payment \"due\" until 2019 because I am so far paid ahead).  I am very committed to paying down all my debt over the next several years, and I am in a good position (with no account for additional income: raises, bonuses, etc.) to do so.\nBased on creditkarma, my credit utilization is at \"D\" (the limit is $9000, and until recently I relied heavily upon the card as a \"back-up\", which I now realize will kill me in the long term if I can't pay off the balance in full each month, and I am determined to get rid of it), my payment history is \"A\" (I have never missed a payment on any debt), my age of credit history is \"F\" (only 1 year and 9 months, although I have had my credit card since 2009?), total accounts is \"B\" (19 total, 15 closed, 4 open - 1 credit card, 3 student loans), credit inquiries \"B\" (1 hard inquiry), and derogatory remarks \"A\" (none).  My overall grade is a \"C\".\nSo, back to my question.  How bad do I look on paper?  I am applying for apartments with my boyfriend and I would hate to be the reason we are rejected.  Also, am I going about repayment in the right way?  At the end of the year, my intent is to spend my (anticipated) bonus paying down my smallest student loan in full, and putting the rest towards my credit card debt (as it has the higher interest rate).  Any additional income, I shoot towards my debt, and while I have a very small savings account, I know that saving is not beneficial while I still have these debts to pay off, with interest accumulating.  \nAny advice?

        "answer_1": "Your credit card debt likely carries a much higher interest rate than your student loans - you should stop paying your student loans and put everything towards your credit card debt, especially if no payments are due until 2019.   In almost every case you should pay down debts starting with that which carries the highest interest rate.\n\nAny additional income, I shoot towards my debt, and while I have a very small savings account, I know that saving is not beneficial while I still have these debts to pay off, with interest accumulating.\n\nNot true.  Having an emergency fund of 4-8 months of expenses can cover you if you suddenly lost your source of income.",

She handed my coworker a copy of The Business of the 21st Century by Robert Kiyosaki to read, and they scheduled a coffee date. They met up again last night and my coworker had more questions like 'how do you make money', 'do you actually have the money you've made in your bank account', and flat out 'is this a pyramid scheme'. The woman said that she has the money in her bank account and it's not a pyramid scheme. The woman then told her what they did (or at used it as an analogy, she wasn't clear so my coworker was confused). Apparently Amazon goes to schools and tells them that if they get their students to order off of Amazon, Amazon will kick back 8% of the revenue to schools (which sounds like regular sales tactics but whatever). This woman's company tries to prevent that, and somehow they make a ton of money from it? The company's name is Bounce (not sure on spelling).\nThe way my coworker got approached makes it sound like a MLM scheme, but since they don't sell any products it sounds like a Ponzi scheme.

This one came from the New York Times. In short, it said that the average salesperson makes $39K per year while the average salary for someone working fulltime is over $50K. The author goes on to say that those who pay high commissions are more likely to attract top talent; however, he fails to mention what happens when all the top talent leaves due to the unrealistic expectations placed upon them by greedy owners. As a result, we see more homes sitting empty as prices continue falling across America. If you think things aren\u2019t bad enough already, consider these facts\u2026 According to Zillow, since July 2007, residential property values fell nearly 10%. That means that between now and then, approximately two million Americans lost almost everything they owned through foreclosures alone. And remember, even though most states allow lenders to repossess properties after just three months behind schedule, many still struggle financially until well past six months later before finally getting caught up again \u2013 sometimes longer still depending where they live. So here lies yet another problem facing potential investors today. They don\u2019t know whether they should try buying cheaply during down cycles only to lose big gains once markets recover OR wait patiently until conditions improve sufficiently enough to justify spending thousands extra dollars purchasing higher quality homes instead. Either way, either path presents significant risks associated primarily with timing issues involved within each respective approach. However, both methods carry inherent dangers which could easily lead consumers astray resulting ultimately into financial ruin unless handled correctly. For instance, let me explain briefly why waiting too long often results badly disastrous consequences including severe losses ranging anywhere from tens thousands $$$$. First off, unlike stocks shares typically trade daily basis whereas single family residences rarely change hands frequently enough enabling prospective bidders sense urgency compel quick decisions leading directly towards making poor choices. Secondarily, mortgages generally require minimum 3% down payment meaning even small mistakes cost dearly especially considering interest charges accumulate rapidly leaving little room maneuver around unforeseen obstacles along journey ahead us. Thirdly, supply demand imbalance continues persistently favoring landlords rather tenants giving renters minimal leverage negotiating terms concessions offered. Fourthly, rental prices tend remain stagnated despite rising costs living expenses creating hardships struggling families everywhere. Fifthly, tax laws heavily penalize investment properties causing major headaches accountants alike. Sixthly, insurance premiums increase dramatically whenever claims filed requiring thorough review coverage plans prior signing contract agreement finalizing transaction completion process. Finally, maintenance requirements regularly exceed original estimates causing constant frustration among participants ensuring smooth sailing experience everyone enjoys. All together, these factors combine create perfect storm forcing unwitting victims accept whatever fate deals hand regardless outcome.

You seem pretty busy considering you also maintain Bogleheads Wiki.\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on the following statement regarding taxes during retirement phase. \u201cIt makes sense to minimize RMDs as long as possible because they will increase adjusted gross income.\u201d This quote comes from https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Roth_... _distribution\nFor example, say someone had $5 million invested in VTSAX + 5% real return. They could withdraw roughly $220,000 per year without exceeding their RMDs. If they took less than this amount, they might save taxes through lower AGI. Would you agree with this statement? Or perhaps the way to look at this is to use the tax brackets instead of AGI? For instance, one might argue that even though one\u2019s AGI increases due to RMDs, marginal tax rate stays flat since bracket doesn\u2019t change. What do you think?\nAlso, what\u2019s your viewpoint on the following quote. \u201cIf you expect to pay capital gains rates after you die, donate appreciated securities today\u201d \u2013 https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=196567.

This fee is charged under Section A4.3.b.vii.ii of the Capital One Credit Card Agreement which states:\n\"If you fail to make purchases totaling at least $10 during each calendar quarter, we reserve the right to close your Account and assess a service fee of $7.95 every month until such time as you use your Account.\"\nNow, according to their agreement, if I spend $10 per quarter, I get free membership into their frequent flyer program. However, I don't travel often enough to take advantage of this offer. So, instead of using the credit card and receiving the reward, I choose not to use the credit card and avoid the $95 annual fee.\nSo far, I haven't paid this fee nor have I used the credit card. Now, however, I received a letter stating that my card has been closed and that I owe them the $95 annual fee. Do I really owe them this amount of money?? Or does Capital One have to prove that they have attempted to contact me via mail several times prior to closing my account??? I plan to ignore the letter and wait to see what happens next......\nDavid\nKevin replied first:\nDave & Jennifer,\nI agree wholeheartedly with David here. He's definitely NOT going to continue to open himself up to further abuse by continuing to deal with this company.\nIn fact, he hasn't done ANYTHING wrong except _not actively participate_. Why should he? His terms state clearly that he gets FREE benefits IF AND ONLY IF he uses the product frequently enough. If he fails to meet the minimum requirements set forth by the contractual relationship between the parties involved, then he loses access to certain features offered by the provider. Period. End of story. No lawsuits necessary!\nWhat amazes me is that companies like CapOne actually expect consumers to read the fine print, understand its implications, and complain whenever they find themselves unable to benefit from its provisions. How absurd!!\nJen Singer responded:\nKevin,\nYou've made a lot of great points, including how ridiculous it seems that companies insist customers understand",

        "question": "I jointly own/finance a car with my father. Father may have some debts going to collections in the future. I may end up being his power of attorney as well. What could happen? TL;DR: I own 50% of car with Dad, with 4 years of payments left. He has no other touchable assets. I cover all payments. Dad's recently in nursing home, only makes money from social security, and has a ton of unpaid debt that he can't afford to pay from being careless with personal loans. I may end up becoming his power of attorney. What kind of liability do I have? Is there any risk of losing the car, or any risk any of this may affect my credit? \nlong version: My dad has a lot of various debts from being extremely careless with taking out loans. Now he's in a nursing home, and those debts may end up going to collections as he can no longer pay. He's lucky enough that one collections agency sent a letter stating some debt had been discharged (which honestly seemed random and out of place, that particular one was only 4 years old) but I'm sure he has plenty more debts ready to pop up. \nI did research and found that they can't touch his home/land, and he doesn't have any real assets. The only thing is the car. We both own 50% of the car, and it still has 4 years left to be paid off. Car payments aren't an issue, I've been paying and never have missed a payment. It's really my car, he just co-signed the loan for me. \nFrom what I read it seems like they could technically take his half of it and buy out my half or something to that extent? Assuming of course they go as far as to take him to court and win. I'm not entirely sure how it works....\nHis only income is social security/disability, and has been for years.\nAlso, with me possibly becoming power of attorney, what kind of debt liability does that give me? I may just end up being healthcare surrogate, but he'll probably end up needing me to be full PoA to manage his money at some point. \nHis credit at this point doesn't really matter, we're just focused on his health. I'm just a bit concerned about losing my car or becoming liable for other debts.",
        "prediction": " If you think otherwise please let me know! Thanks so much :)",
        "answer_1": "Before they could take the car, assuming you are current on payments, they'd have to first sue your father and get a judgement to try to collect against his assets.  Since trying to go after half the equity in a vehicle that you also own would be pretty complicated, I don't see most collection agencies wanting to go after that, unless it's like a Porsche Primavera or something.\nThe fact that there is a loan outstanding also increases the degree of difficulty faced by the collection agency.\nYour assets are not at risk from you having power of attorney.  ",
        "answer_2": "You're fine as long as you keep making payments on it and your father doesn't need to file bankruptcy. The other debts are the other debts and will only impact his credit, not yours unless you signed for them as well.\nIn the event of bankruptcy, you would want to refinance it to be only in your name or sell the car before that happens."

I then do my due diligence on  the properties which includes CMA and searching my county clerk's website for any outstanding liens. \nThere are plenty of risks. When you buy at auction you have to pay cash (cashier's check on the spot). You are buying a property sight unseen without any sort of seller's disclosure. The home could be (and usually is) occupied. Once you have purchased the home you need to find a way to enter the home if vacant or get the occupants out if occupied (cash for keys or eviction). Sometimes the information that you have on the house is incorrect  (eg- the home only has 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom when you thought it was a 3/2).\nThere are many risks purchasing at auction so you need to make sure that you buy the home at a sufficient discount in order to not get burned when the unexpected arises.\nBuying foreclosed homes that are bank owned is much easier. You can often use financing and you get to actually go inside the property during the showing. There is still no sellers disclosure when purchasing REO properties.",
        "answer_2": "Lots of good info in this thread. But for other novice would-be buyers I want to make a couple points. \nFirst, there are 3 types of value. Auction or liquidation value (lowest), market value (what we think of typical real estate transactions), and insurance value (highest value). \nLenders (GSE anyway, hard money lenders may be an exception but rates are steep) have minimum property requirements and standards and will not loan on houses that do not meet these. Many REO and auction properties either do not meet these or they are a risk for GSE lenders because they have not been inspected or appraised. They sell cheap because the only buyers are those with plenty of cash (although as has been mentioned, there are often cash buyers competing for these). \nIf someone needs a loan, they will be buying at market value, not auction or liquidation value. It is possible to buy a fixer upper at the low end of the market, such as if you do a 203K rehab loan, and put in some improvements and sweat equity to add value. But in general, the big discounts are going to cash buyers and they get a discount because of the risk and unknowns, and also because the only market is other cash buyers. \nBuying auction/liquidation is a very specialized and risky thing and no first time home buyer should even attempt this.

So just switching to Cdn would be doing something dumb like moving money from a 10% return market (U.S.) over to one where there is only an average 6-7% expected return (Canada). You might want to consider adding some international exposure instead as most of those markets offer higher returns.

If inflation gets high enough before our next rate hike (which probably won't happen until late next year) then yes we may see parity between us and them sooner rather than later. As far as being able to generate good yields inside an RRSP account goes - sure, absolutely, although not necessarily through individual securities since many companies don't currently provide any taxable distributions which means no capital gains either unless you sell them first.

If we look back historically over time, how many people who are earning under $35K per year typically qualified for a home purchase at some point within their life? Not necessarily right now but at some point throughout history? About 8% of Americans actually fit those criteria. You might say, \u201cwell that\u2019s not very high,\u201d but when you consider the fact that there are only four things required by most lenders in order to approve somebody; they must demonstrate that they have adequate income, they must show that they have sufficient assets, they must prove that they have good credit, and then finally they must document their employment status. Of these four items, the one item that has probably changed the least over time is the ability to document steady income because human nature never really changes. Even though our economy may change every five years, human nature doesn\u2019t tend to change much between generations which means that if someone has been working steadily for six months straight already prior to applying for a loan program like FHA or VA, then chances are pretty darned good that he/she could continue to work just fine after closing too unless something unexpected happens along the way during escrow such as losing his job due perhaps either illness sick leave absence etcetera.

I'd talk to a lender and figure out what you need to qualify for an owner occupied loan youll need an income and tax returns getting a co signer will help but the bank needs to know you can keep the payments up. You can start with under 20k of course this is market dependent but for this particular strategy its more than enough.

This was largely due to the fact that he didn't find himself enjoying city living anymore. So selling it wasn't difficult; he got back almost every \u00a3 he paid for it plus profit. Had he rented it out during that period he probably would have lost money. But the main point is that he knew from day one that he did NOT intend to live there forever. And now he knows he made a wise decision by selling while prices were still low.\nHe lives in a rural part of Wales these days & loves it.\nSo I guess my answer to your original post is......it depends entirely upon circumstances.....but yes you CAN achieve capital growth through owning bricks and mortar even though many people seem to disagree with that statement.",

Buy a house because you really want to own a home. Going into a house with the pure thought of it being an investment is not the right mindset.\n\nI'll be moving house within the next 6-12 months anyway, which is partly what prompted me considering purchasing over renting.\n\nAbsolutely, definitely, 100% no. There is no way I can even fathom you making back any kind of return after 12 months.",
        "answer_2": "\nbut I'm wondering if this might be a good financial option given the state of the UK property market, and also compared to leaving it sitting in a bank account for a long time or risking it in some other investment opportunity that I don't fully understand.\n\nBuying property requires a lot more understanding, involvement, and time investment than simply buying an index fund.  Basically, it sounds like you don't particularly want a house, you just want an investment to park your money in for the next ten or so years -- so why would you immediately jump to buying a house instead of the much simpler option of investing?  Investing in stocks isn't particularly complicated.  It's way less complicated than closing on a house, anyway."

        "question": "[DEBT] Settlement offer on defaulted student loan...not sure what the best choice is. I have one student loan that went into default when I was unemployed several years ago. The rest of my disbursements are in good standing as they allowed me a forbearance during that time, but Sallie Mae was an asshole so here I am.\nI got a letter from the most recent collector my account was assigned to, and they are offering me a settlement. It's less than I originally borrowed and I can easily pay it right now. However, I don't care even a tiny bit about what is moral or right, I just want the most positive result for my credit score.\nSo, here's my dilemma. I know from annualcreditreport.com that this loan will cease to show up on my credit report in a year and a half. As far as I understand it, that means no one will see that the charge off/default ever happened. That's fantastic because I have had tremendous trouble getting a car loan because of this defaulted debt.\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years. I'm aware of pay for delete agreements and such, but the settlement offer doesn't contain any such offer and I don't know if I want to mess with that and just trust that they'll follow through. So, my first big question is does anyone know if this will actually help my credit, or if I would have better results by just waiting a year and a half for it to fall off and never touch it again? \nMy other concern if I do decide to take the settlement is that, since this is through a private collection agency, somehow the info will never properly get communicated back to Sallie Mae (well, Navient now). I assume as long as I keep the offer, a copy of the check I pay it with, and other documentation I can quickly shut down any future agency that tries to collect on it as well, but I'd rather not have to deal with that hassle forever. Is there any other good way to make sure this really ends forever with my payment?",
        "prediction": " Do you think I should try calling them afterward to verify everything has been handled correctly before closing out all communication? Or maybe I could send a certified letter saying I expect confirmation within x days otherwise I will file suit against them due to violating their contractual agreement to remove it once paid in full? If I were going to go that route though, wouldn't I be better off doing some kind of Pay For Delete thing where I give them money anyway without expecting anything more in return?\nFinally, I realize I probably sound like a complete idiot who needs a life coach at this point, but I've been dealing with these things myself and am honestly confused enough to need someone else's opinion. I hope I haven't gone too much overboard with details considering how many people will read this post! Thanks very much for your advice.\nsubmitted by /u/growl0982",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the industry, and while I am not an expert by any means, I think I can help point you in the right direction (take it all with a grain of salt though).\nIf this is a federal loan, then you cannot discharge via bankruptcy, and they don't even need to sue you to start garnishment (kind of like the IRS).  There is also no SOL, and you should try to take care of this as soon as possible.\nGetting passed around to different collection agencies is not good, and a typical indicator of more drastic measures being taken in the near future.  You should also ask them to verify the debt to ensure you are paying the right loan with the right agency.\nThe default status is what is killing your credit report, and it will not go away until 7 years after the account is \"closed\" either via charge off or settlement.  They do seem to be willing to be reasonable, so I am sure you can get them to agree to report this as settled on your credit, which should help you out (especially if this is your only bad account).  I have seen people bounce back from chapter 7 bankruptcy in just over a year, so you should be able to do the same if you are careful.\nYou should not have a problem with them reporting the settlement to the loan servicer.  They will not get paid until the loan servicer pays them, so they are highly motivated to report correctly.  You can always ask them to put into writing anything you are not certain of, please do not just trust them to do something without talking to them about it.  This is more for documentation purposes, in case you have any additional issues come up with the account (especially with the credit agencies or a new lender).  Also request a final letter once the settlement has been paid.  They probably already do this, but it should be mentioned just in case.",
        "answer_2": "\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years.\n\nCredit reporting is always based on the date of first delinquency, no matter whether you pay the account or not. If you pay it, it will still fall off 1.5 years from now.\nDo your research on the collection agency, too. Find out what tactics other people have used."

Here are the three successful and two failed FIRE journeys that I am familiar with.\nSuccess stories:\n\nI had a fairly typical IT career, starting out as an entry-level programmer and ending up as a project manager. The key difference was that I maintained the same standard of living while my income increased, which made me FI in my early 40s.

However, eventually the stress of corporate life became too much and I FIREd in my mid-40s.\nA friend whom I\u2019ll call \u201cA\u201d had a business degree. He messed around in his 20s, then started a business in his 30s. The business had its ups and downs, but was fairly successful overall. When he was in his early 50s, he sold it and FIRED.\nA friend whom I\u2019ll call \u201cB\u201d leveraged his STEM PhD to go into banking. He was very successful, became FI in his 30s and eventually FIREd.\n\nFailed FIREs:\n\nAn acquaintance whom I\u2019ll call \u201cC\u201d had a small IT business in his 30s and 40s. He thought that he had made enough money to live on and FIRED in his 40s. Less than 10 years later he realized how expensive giving a top-notch education to his 4 children was going to be and chose to go back to work to finance it.\nAn acquaintance whom I\u2019ll call \u201cD\u201d ran a small mom and pop shop in his 30s and early 40s. He figured that a few hundred K should be enough to live on in a low COL area, so he sold the business and invested in stocks.

It's frustrating because my income is already taxed 40% and being able to max out my 401k and my HSA is one of the only ways I'm able to reduce my taxable income. I don't really understand why these limits exist when people with higher income also get taxed at higher rates already...\nFurthermore, when we take money out of our 401ks it still gets taxed anyway. :\\\nRant aside - what do you guys do to compensate for this?

        "answer_1": "No. Company 401k policies are NOT NEGOTIABLE.  The company is required by law to have the same policies for all employees in the group.  Some very large employers have multiple groups, with multiple 401k plans with different rules, but these are rare exceptions and even then they are required to put employees into the appropriate plan by some definitive rules, such as subsidiary A employees into plan A and subsidiary plan B employees into plan B.\nMany legal restrictions exist to prevent employers from favoring select employees, such as highly paid workers or management.  This also means that they are legally restricted from waiving rules like waiting periods, vesting or modifying matching for select favored employees.  You will NOT be able to negotiate different 401k rules for a single employee.\nThere are no legal restrictions on vacation policy, time off, work from home rules, benefits such as health care and so on.  Some companies (usually smaller ones) do allow negotiating benefit packages and employee/employer costs for benefits.  You can also negotiate sign-on bonus and severance agreements.  But you are legally not entitled to different 401k treatment from all other employees.  Attempting to negotiate 401k rules is a waste of time.",

That said, Ally isn't bad either -- though, like all brick-and-mortar institutions these days, they're pretty low compared to what used to be normal back in the early '90s before big banks started buying each other up en masse. For example, this article says that some of the old Midwest regional banks were paying something north of 5% even ten years ago.\nIn any case, while Ally doesn't offer branch access, its website lists hundreds of thousands of fee free ATM locations nationwide including Allpoint Network (a very large network), which includes several major chains such as Walgreens, CVS Pharmacy, Rite Aid, etc., plus a number of local chains as well. So finding somewhere nearby shouldn't be difficult. And, since they list the exact address, location services on your phone should help guide you right there.\nBank of America does indeed seem to have a problematic policy regarding excessive amounts being put onto accounts via external channels. They seem to allow unlimited transfers through their app and online system directly linked to checking / savings accounts, but after that things get tricky. If you haven't already, call BofA customer service and ask them why they won't accept more than x dollars per transaction (say, $10K?) using billpay, check mailing, wire transfer, etc. You never know until you actually speak to someone who knows exactly what they're talking about.\nposted by saulgoodman at 8:02 AM on April 22, 2014\nBest answer: Ally seems fine, but if you move everything else to Ally, you lose access to Bill Payment. My understanding is that if you ever set up automatic payment from your BOA checking account, you can no longer cancel those recurring charges, because BOA closes the connection between the two accounts. This means if you ever decide you want to stop sending money to Company X, Y, Z, you cannot anymore unless you contact company X, Y, Z and explain the situation and hope they send you a new request form. In general, people say Bill Pay works great except for this quirk.\nAlso, I believe BOA still offers the ability to write paper checks, whereas Ally does not.\nSo basically, if you plan to completely close your BOA account, consider keeping a small amount ($1-$5k?) open solely for automated bill payment purposes. Then you can make occasional manual deposits into Ally.\n(This assumes you aren't concerned about having physical branches around.)\nposted by lunasol at 8:03 AM on April 22, 2014\nSeconding lunasol re: BillPay.

And I'm ashamed to admit that I am grossly underprepared for this moment. So here are my questions:\n1) What brokerage can she open her account? I'm using Robinhood, however they don't allow minors to open an account. Brokerage that allows partial share is great too.\n2) What type of stocks should she get into? I asked her to do some homework of stocks she'd like to get, and she came back with a list of things (Disney, Nike, etc)\n3) What other type of investment that a 16 yo can get into?

But there still can be big differences between different models or even within model years. For example, we found some 2014 Hyundai Sonatas had more than double the number of problems compared to others from the same year! So you need to do your homework before buying any vehicle.\nIf you want something reliable, consider a Toyota Prius (hybrid), Honda Accord/Civic, Nissan Altima, Subaru Legacy, Chevy Malibu, Ford Fusion, or Mazda6 sedan; these all have good track records based on our survey results. Or if you prefer an SUV or crossover, look into a Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX350L hybrids, Buick Enclave, Acura MDX, Volvo XC90 V8 Sport Utility Vehicles; they also tend toward being less problematic over time according to Consumer Reports surveys. However keep in mind that most people don't drive enough miles per day or weekly mileages vary widely depending upon where one lives - so it might not make sense financially speaking unless someone has access via public transportation options like buses etc.. It could take longer then expected when purchasing such expensive items especially since many dealerships offer limited warranties only lasting up until three months after delivery date but sometimes go beyond six months later too due mainly because some parts fail early during use period while other components remain perfectly fine throughout entire lifecycle without breaking down ever again despite having been driven hundreds thousands times already by now...\n###\nQ: How often does my car require routine service? And what kind of things will I find out once I get under its hood?\nA: If you own an older vehicle, expect to pay around $70\u2013$100 every few thousand miles for basic services including oil changes and tuneups. Newer ones may cost closer to $300-$400 each visit due mostly because they typically include additional work such as transmission fluid exchanges along with belts replacement among other things.

And in the used car market, I feel like it's not that a X year old car is necessarily a good deal (or a car with X miles).  If you watch the market for a while, you'll learn the market price for cars at a certain age or with certain mileage, and you'll be able to spot a good deal when you see one.

That's what I believe, and that's what the OP asked.\nSmall note - unless you are Jewish, you aren't \"tithing\" - tithing is more or less an Old Testament requirement.

I don't really feel it'd be wrong either way though, as I'm supposed to give cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7).  I should give as much as I can, with the fact in mind that 10% is what was required when the law (OT) was not perfect.

After that point, it becomes your responsibility to pursue remedy through other means, such as contacting local authorities.\nYour best bet might be to speak directly with a representative of the bank's Fraud Department, whose job it is to deal specifically with these types of matters.

        "question": "Should I dump 2/3rds of my savings on student loans? I graduated college in 2012 with $26k in student loans. 7 years later, I still owe $14,644 with an interest rate at 4.875%.  I recently increased my monthly payment from the minimum of $120 a month to $300 a month - I'll have my loan paid off in April 2024 and my servicer will have gotten more than $1,700 in interest from me.\nTo be honest, I'm sick of looking at this debt. I have $9,100 in my savings account which gives me 1.88% APY. Doing the math, it makes more sense to dump much of my savings onto the loan as it'd save me more money that what I'm making with the savings account. \nWhat I'm thinking about doing is dumping $6,100 from my savings onto the loan, which brings the loan balance down to about $8,544. I'll have $3,000 left in my savings as an emergency fund. I'll then increase my monthly payment to $900 a month which will get my loan paid off around July 2020 (this also leaves my with just over $100 a month extra after all my expenses like food, rent, car insurance, etc). My servicer will only get about $200 in interest from me by then.\nAfter the loan is paid off, assuming I don't get a raise between now and then, I'll have my student loan completely paid off which means I'll have $1,000 extra per month toward whatever I want - but I can easily get my savings built back up to what it was after months\nI've also considered other places to put my money that would earn me more, but I haven't come across anything with low risk and would yield greater than 4.875%. \nThere's definitely an emotional element to this - letting go of $6,100 is tough. Maybe I'm seeking emotional support from r/personalfinance but I'm also looking for a sanity check.

Sorry its kinda long winded...\nRe: What should i do with my 401K??\nPost by nisiprius \u00bb Tue Mar 07, 2017 8:49 am\nIt sounds like your employer has made available a \"hardship distribution\" feature under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k)(2) (the section governing hardships). If that is true, then you could take a hardship distribution from your account without incurring a penalty tax. You couldn't do this for yourself; only for medical expenses--and, within limits, the definition of \"medical expense\" includes more than simply medical bills. It includes things like home modifications required due to disability, etc., although exactly where the line between permissible and impermissible uses crosses isn't clear. There may even be ways of getting a loan against the balance instead of taking a full-fledged distribution, although I wouldn't rely upon them. Here's a link to IRS Publication 590, page 27, describing these provisions. https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/#... e_Public_P\nThe problem is that these distributions aren't always easy to obtain. Your first step needs to be asking your HR department whether they allow hardship distributions, and if they do, finding out how many employees have actually used that option recently. Then, assuming you decide to pursue it further, find out how difficult it is to arrange a hardship distribution and ask whether anybody else has done so lately. And then start thinking about whether you would really want to spend all that time fighting through red tape when you have better things to do.\nIf none of those doors open to you, then you probably have two choices: put off saving until you think you understand your own future prospects better, or roll over the funds to an individual retirement account, preferably Roth IRAs rather than traditional ones, since the latter are subject to income restrictions. Even though you haven't been employed very long, you still qualify to contribute to a Roth, and if you were to do so, you could contribute $5,500 per year ($6,500 starting next year), plus another $1,000 if you're 50+ years old. That's $6,500 +$1,000 = $7,500 per year. This would give you access to both immediate contributions and deferred compounding interest on earnings accumulated after you turned 59\u00bd.\nThere are lots of people whose lives turn upside down unexpectedly, including death of spouse, divorce, loss of job, illness, injury, lawsuits, foreclosures, bankruptcies, and so forth. For most of us, our financial planning is based on the assumption that we will continue along in essentially the same way forever. This is called \"life expectancy.\" We base everything on a median lifespan expectation. A lot of people die earlier than expected, but others live longer. Most of us end up somewhere close to the middle. When circumstances change radically, suddenly everybody finds themselves living outside the bell curve.\nIn general terms, if you have enough assets saved already, you shouldn't let short term bad luck ruin your long term plans.\nBut, having said all that, if you find yourself in dire straights right now, I'd look seriously into applying for Social Security Disabilty benefits immediately. This is especially important given the fact that you have a chronic illness. There's nothing wrong with looking forward to retiring sometime later, but you should definitely protect yourself financially while you wait.\nLast edited by nisiprius on Wed Mar 08, 2017 8:29 pm, edited 1 time in total.\nPost by jlawrence01 \u00bb Tue Mar 07, 2017 9:22 am\nYou didn't mention what type of 401k plan your company offers, Traditional vs. ROTH.

Yes, most people expect that markets will decline at times, but not all do. It also matters where you live - if you lived somewhere where the market had never gone down then you might well believe that nothing ever goes down...and thus get caught out by a major correction.\n\nAs for individual stocks vs mutual funds, many people who own individual stocks don't sell them because they've been holding onto those shares since long before the current price levels were achieved so they aren't worried about short term fluctuations. Some people buy individual stocks as part of a diversified strategy which means they may hold onto one share while selling another. That said, mutual fund managers can still make bad decisions and end up being forced to dump positions in order to meet redemption requests from nervous investors.\n\nAs far as indexes go, yes, they tend to fall more than actively managed funds. This has two causes; firstly an active manager doesn't usually try to time the market perfectly, instead trying to reduce volatility overall. Secondly, active management tends to result in higher fees, and high fees mean lower returns. Index funds don't charge much in terms of annual expenses compared to actively managed ones.

In this meeting I began by telling him I was\n\nUnhappy with my compensation.\nThat because of my contributions to the company, X revenue was generated.\nThat because of 2., he could expect me to bring in Y revenue in the future.\nThat a 25% raise was eminently fair based on 2. and 3.\nAt this point, I knew that I was in for a dime, in for a dollar, so I asked for a bonus equal to 50% of my annual salary.\n\nHe told me that a 25% raise would make me the highest paid employee with my title, and that it was more in line with what managers were making.

        "question": "How to calculate a pension or pension increases vs. savings for retirement TLDR: Golden Handcuffs question. How to calculate the equivalence of a pension vs retirement savings accounts. \nSo, I am one of the lucky few to have a pension. I am already vested. The way it is structured is based on years worked, age and highest average earnings over a 3 year period. Just got a promotion last year. Am in the last few stages of my pre FIRE life. I'm trying to evaluate whether to work 2 1/2 more years or 1 1/2 more years. \nI will be able to meet our expected expenses (with some room to spare) with 403b, IRAs and pension in 1 1/2 more years.  But, if I worked one more year, I would get about $8k more per year in my pension (67k vs 75k per year).   This would give us a nice cushion. \nBut, my job is quite stressful with this promotion and I don't know if it's worth it. \nOne way to calculate the worth of a pension would be to value it at the 4% withdrawal rate. So, 8k would equal $200,000 in a retirement account.  However, when my spouse and I both pass, there will be no assets left from this theoretical sum. So another way to calculate it would be to estimate my life expectancy and then a withdrawal rate that would spend down the principal in that time. I think this would be around a 8% withdrawal rate for me.  That would mean that an 8k increase = 100,000 in retirement savings. \nAny thoughts on this?  \nThe reason I am asking is that most FIRE or other retirement calculations are based on a pot of money that you withdraw from and not from a pension. \n$8k per year is a nice reliable increase, but frankly, my stress might not be worth it. This equivalency scenario seems to be one that would help me make the decision. \nThanks!",
        "prediction": " \nP.S.: I realize that most people do not plan their finances using a 4% WR because they can't predict how long they will live or what returns they will receive, etc. My point was simply that you could use it as a rough guidepost in comparing different scenarios where you had differing amounts of income available. For example, let's say you were planning your early retirement budget. You calculated that you needed $5K per month to cover all of your living expenses. You had two options. Option A - Retire now and start collecting Social Security benefits immediately which will provide $2K per month ($1K less than your target amount.) Or option B- Work until full retirement age and continue working part time afterward so you can keep getting paid by employer X.  If you go with option b, you may end up making more money than you need each month since you aren't paying into SS anymore. However, once again, we must remember that SS won't last forever either unless Congress changes things drastically before we reach old age ourselves. In order words, maybe instead of taking out loans against future wages like many Americans do today; perhaps we should look toward investments such as stock market index funds instead? Maybe even consider buying rental properties along side those stock portfolios too! Either way though ; whatever path chosen, always strive towards financial independence first rather than focusing solely upon accumulating wealth alone. Because without enough capital saved away, neither route will lead anywhere useful anyway...

Obviously, to get a more accurate number you have to factor in inflation, age, life expectancy, etc. That being said, a $67k pension is quite a nest egg already (worth about $1M) so the answer depends on your expenses and whether the pension is inflation-adjusted.\nTo help with your FIRE calculations, I would recommend the [\"Rich, Broke, or Dead\" Early Retirement Calculator](  treating the pension and other benefits like Social Security separate from your investments in the \"Extra Income\" tab.

I have almost a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet that I have been paying on for a couple of years now (terrible I know). Late last year, I hit some hard times and missed a couple of payments (again, terrible, I know). Because my Nelnet account is split 10 different ways, they hit my credit 10 different times for each late payment, resulting in 20 negative statements on my credit for only 2 actual missed payments. \nI tried to work with Nelnet to consolidate those late payments into just two, but they were unwilling to work with me on that. After some more research, I ended up disputing the late payments with the three bureaus. My justification simply asked that they consolidate the missed payments down to the two that actually occurred.\nLast week, I received a statement from Equifax saying that the account information on my Nelnet accounts had been updated, which I thought was good news, but further inspection showed that all the late payments were still present.\nFast forward to today when I checked my credit report on CreditKarma to see that the late payments with Nelnet had ballooned from 20 to 40. Additionally, my recorded payment history went from something like 650 down to 447 payments on file. \nHow is this possible? The adviser at Nelnet suggested I consolidate, which would not take care of anything in the past, but might look good on my credit report.

        "question": "One of my cards has an annual fee. Close it? I filed for a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy a little over 3 years ago after losing my home. Since then, my credit has recovered modestly. (650 on TU right now) I have several open cards, most of them have relatively low limits, and they're all carrying a zero balance. I try not to use them unless I can pay them off the same month.\nAnyway, of all the cards, only the one issued to me by Credit One has an annual fee, which they charge to me monthly. I've been thinking about closing it, since I've got to send them $8.33 every month just to have the card. However, I know age of accounts is a thing on credit reports, and helping the score recover is my main focus right now. The card is one of the first i was able to get after the B13 and has my second highest limit of all my accounts, which is also valuable in a pinch.\nSo, with all that being said, should I close it and take the hit on my report (don't know how substantial it would be) or just continue paying the $8 to have it on there as an older account, decent limit, and no balance?",

I bet it would drop by ten points or less.\nEDIT: Also try using creditkarma.com and their credit simulator to see what it does if you were to close your oldest account."

        "question": "ELI5: The interaction between unemployment and wage stagnation. What pressures are acting to keep wages flat? In theory, it seems that low unemployment would drive up wages as companies are competing harder to find talent.\nWhat other pressures are acting on the job market to keep wage growth flat despite really low unemployment and an economy that\u2019s growing?",
        "prediction": " I think of this in terms of supply/demand curves for labor (i.e., workers). But what else is happening here besides just a simple increase or decrease in demand from employers? \u2013 TJ\nThe short answer is that you have been thinking about this incorrectly! We don't look at things like supply & demand curves when talking about wages. Instead we use something called \"equilibrium\". This concept has nothing to do with economics; instead it comes from physics. It simply means that there exists some point where forces are balanced out against eachother. For example if someone pushes me then my body will resist by pushing back equally hard so long as neither side moves too far away from their equilibrium position before stopping - otherwise they could end up falling over due to lack o balance which wouldn't happen unless both people were trying very hard indeed!. Equilibrum does not mean perfect equality though because sometimes one person may be stronger than another but still remain close enough together such that no extra force needs apply anymore after reaching this state whereas others might require more effort depending upon how much strength difference existed initially..\nIn regards specifically towards your question however...there aren't many factors involved here since most jobs available today fall under either category A) entry level positions requiring little experience needed beyond high school diploma OR B) skilled tradesman positions requiring years worth training prior being hired full time anywhere near minimum wage range even though technically speaking anything above 10$ per hour counts officially considered living WAGES according definition provided within article titled 'Minimum Wage Laws'. So basically speaking anyone looking get paid higher amounts must first obtain necessary skills required fulfill certain requirements set forth company offering those types opportunities usually starting somewhere around $20-$30K salary annually once employed permanently full-time basis until retirement age arrives roughly thirty five forty years later assuming employee stays healthy throughout entirety working period without suffering any major injuries along way leading eventually into early death caused heart attack stroke etcetera....\nSo basically speaking anyone wanting earn more money should start learning new skills right now whether its through college classes vocational programs apprenticeships internships whatever floats boats works best suited individual situation present moment time frame concerned!!",

        "question": "What if I don't want to retire? I keep reading that everyone should maximize retirement savings. Indeed I have been saving 6-10% of my income into my 401k ever since I started working, and I feel like I'm in a solid place. But I don't want to contribute much more than that - I can't really imagine myself retiring. I love my career, feel very fulfilled, and my work gives me a huge sense of purpose. \nHow does your advice change for someone who wants to extend their retirement? Instead of maxing my retirement accounts, I'd rather save aggressively for a house or invest my money to be able to upgrade my lifestyle while I'm young, especially since I plan to work until an old age. Am I missing something? ",
        "prediction": "\nI would recommend you do both: Save as much as possible toward retirement (and take advantage of the employer match), but also pay off debts early on so you are not wasting away any time in life doing things you hate because you need to make ends meet. It is important to understand how much you will need to live comfortably during retirement, which means making some educated guesses about what expenses you expect to face after stopping work. You may find it helpful to talk with people whose careers have mirrored yours\u2014how did they manage financially when they retired from full-time jobs? Did they go back part-time? If yes, why didn't they just stay at the same job longer? How long were they out before going back part-time? What about health insurance costs? Do they continue contributing to Social Security? These types of questions help paint a picture of what kind of postretirement budget might look like, and give you insight into whether you will truly be able to afford to stop earning altogether.\nThe best way to get there is by living below your means today. The less stressful your financial situation is now, the better prepared you will be later. This is true no matter where you fall on this spectrum!\nRetired or Not Retired? That Is the Question\nYou may think that deciding between being a \"pre-retiree\" versus a fully fledged \"retiree,\" or even taking a break along the path, depends solely upon personal preference. Well, sort of...\nIt turns out there are many factors beyond our control that determine exactly _when_ we choose to leave the traditional nine-to-five world behind. Here are three biggies:\n**Federal government benefits programs.** Your eligibility for Medicare begins at sixty-two years of age; however, delaying enrollment past seventy causes your premiums to increase substantially. For those under fifty-nine, the penalty for late signup is higher still. In addition, once you reach the minimum age required for social security benefits, your monthly checks start coming in right around then too. So unless you enjoy eating cat food, having zero dollars left over each year to spend on yourself becomes a nonstarter pretty quickly.\n**State pension plans.** As mentioned earlier, most states offer defined benefit plans based on final salary multiplied by years worked plus average wage increases per year throughout one's entire tenure within state service. The only catch here is that these amounts must be paid back through regular deductions taken directly from employee paychecks every single week or biweekly period depending upon individual circumstances. A typical worker could receive anywhere from $25\u2013$30K annually depending upon his/her own contribution rate percentage compared against total compensation received prior to leaving public sector positions forevermore.*\n**Company-sponsored medical coverage.** Most large companies provide employees access to group healthcare policies covering everything from doctor visits all the way down towards prescription medications purchased via mail order pharmacies online.* However, these options become increasingly expensive without fail due largely because corporate budgets simply cannot accommodate such generous levels anymore given current economic conditions combined alongside rising inflation rates across consumer goods markets nationwide.\nWhat Does All Of This Mean To Us Pre-Retires?\nIf nothing else, knowing precisely WHEN TO RETIRE matters immensely regardless whether one chooses voluntarily resign themselves entirely away from labor force participation permanently OR temporarily step aside briefly allowing others opportunities instead.\nFor example, say someone works diligently enough achieving high level promotions leading eventually upward becoming executive vice president somewhere deep inside Fortune 100 conglomerates located headquartered right smack dab downtown Chicago Illinois USA area. After reaching peak achievement status finally receiving accolades rewarding hard earned efforts accumulated over course last few decades spent climbing rungs ladder successive professional advancement levels slowly yet steadily gaining greater power influence authority respect admiration prestige recognition honor dignity esteem fame fortune wealth prosperity abundance richness luxury pleasure satisfaction contentment happiness joy delight ecstasy exuberant excitement rapturous bliss ecstatic jubilation euphoria glee mirth merriment gladness good cheer cheery optimism positivity hopefulness anticipatory expectation eagerness enthusiasm zest vigor vitality energy verve sparkle vivacity liveliness sprightliness vim vigour zip zeal dynamism spirit spunk brio flair panache dash dexterity nimbleness lithe suppleness flexibility limberness springiness buoyancy lightheart",
        "answer_1": "Retirement (or in your case a better term is financial independence) is just one goal. If you have other goals, or worse, consumer debt, backing off on the retirement saving so you can meet that goal is fine. You say you want to buy a house. Buying a house is a good goal. You can have it paid off by the time you are retirement age, which would help a lot with monthly expenses. I would still try to get the full company match. For example, if your company matches 5%, and your putting in 10%, going down to 5% for a few years is okay. If you just stop contributing altogether, you are leaving money on the table.\nNot everyone has the same idea of what retirement is. A lot of people share this idea of never working again, and just lounging around all day, or traveling. Other people (including people like Warren Buffet, who's 87) never retire in that sense. Instead they do work that they enjoy, secure in the knowledge that they could quit at anytime and still be well off financially. That's what financial independence is. Having an income from a job is nice, but having your 401k, IRA, etc after 59.5 means you aren't dependant on that income. If your boss  is an ass towards you, you can just walk out without giving it a second thought. ",
        "answer_2": "You may not have the luxury of choosing whether to retire or not.  When the time comes, better to have more savings than you need if you are lucky enough to have it be totally your choice.\nI mean, don't limit yourself to a hard and fast \"x%\" rule, those are blunt instruments.  Run a calculator and figure out what path you're on.  If it looks ok to you, looks like something can live with if you are forced to retire earlier than you expect, then go for it.\nAt the end of the day, the only one you have to answer to is yourself or, depending on situation, your family.

If younger then that, then just leave it where it is as you won\u2019t pay tax now anyway. There isn\u2019t much point moving an older plan unless there were big fees involved or something similar.

Also, since you have already paid for everything else associated with moving and such, don't feel like you owe anyone anything further - unless you had agreed upon something specific beforehand then it sounds more like they screwed up rather than you did.\nposted by phoenixy at 9:08 AM on March 20, 2014 [3 favorites]\nIf all you care about is making sure you aren't stuck paying for expenses related to the move, why wouldn't you simply agree to extend your stay until Monday morning? That's probably worth $X amount to you, right? You could even go ahead and book the hotel room now, assuming they will cover the cost. Seems pretty straightforward...\nThat said, asking for additional compensation beyond covering the costs you incurred due to having to wait longer doesn't seem reasonable to me; however, given how long ago this occurred, perhaps you guys have decided otherwise. Good luck!\nposted by kimberussell at 9:13 AM on March 20, 2014\nThis happens sometimes when agents forget to communicate properly between buyer / seller agents regarding terms of sale. Sounds like nobody actually read the contract carefully enough. It might be helpful to see what the original contract says about possession date vs. \"closing\" which is often used interchangeably but means different things legally speaking. If both sides really intended for the buyers to move into the house immediately, then the sellers were wrongfully holding onto the property past its legal time limit. But if the closing date is separate from actual possession date, well... yeah, sorry. Sometimes these things happen.\nPersonal opinion here: I don't understand why the sellers would expect to give the new owners only 30 days. That seems very short. Is Ohio law normal there? Or does the area around Columbus tend towards shorter times?\nIn my experience, most home sales involve giving the new owner keys within 24 hours of signing papers. In fact, in one case where I closed late afternoon Friday, the selling agent came over early Saturday morning to let us know she'd dropped off the key in the mailbox. Whenever possible, I try to avoid being locked out. So I usually plan on leaving a couple weeks earlier anyway.\nBut yes, if the sellers made a mistake in misunderstanding the agreement, it falls squarely on them. They should fix it, not you.\n(And btw, it isn't always easy finding pet friendly hotels.)\nposted by tacodave at 9:15 AM on March 20, 2014 [1 favorite]\nThe contract may say \"possession at closing\". This is standard language. However, people who negotiate real estate deals regularly know that the term \"occupancy\" has come to mean \"move in\", regardless of whether the lease starts later. Most agents and attorneys also know this and use the word \"occupancy\" instead of \"possession.\" I suspect the sellers' agents knew exactly what they meant by using the phrase \"occupancy at closing,\" but unfortunately they forgot to tell their client.\nYou can certainly ask for compensation for the delay. A few hundred dollars each shouldn't break the bank. But keep in mind that it wasn't intentional. There are plenty of situations where good faith efforts fail and someone gets hurt.\nposted by mistersquid at 9:16 AM on March 20, 2014 [2 favorites]\nWell, first, check the paperwork again. Make certain that no one made mistakes writing down dates etc. Second, the seller is responsible for repairs, cleaning, inspections, and other aspects leading up to and including settlement. The buyer pays fees and taxes, plus the price of the house itself. Third, if the seller wants to renegotiate the agreement, he or she must contact YOU via email, letter, phone call, text message, smoke signals, or carrier pigeon. You cannot initiate conversations yourself. Fourth, if you are able to find a place to live and get moved in quickly, consider",
        "answer_1": "Whatever you do, do not close until they are out. Have your realtor/lawyer impose a $1000 purchase price reduction/closing credit (depends if loans are involved or not) for every single day they delay the closing. They'll be out in 5 days, tops.",
        "answer_2": "I have bought several houses in Indiana and Illinois and it was customary for sellers to have 30 days to move.

I dont think the sellers are on the hook as much as their agent. I would encourage your agent to talk to their broker and see if you all can work something out.\nI understand why they were surprised, but their agent should have told them."

        "question": "Turns out my knee surgery was at an out of network hospital. We owe $20k. February 29 I had ACL surgery. I've been with this doctor for 4 years, he's operated on this knee before, but at a different hospital (Lakeside Hospital, new orleans).  So we have history, they know I'm with Aetna.  So when they told me I needed surgery again we went ahead and scheduled it, my Dr told me it would be at a different hospital, Omega Hospital. A couple days later they called me and confirmed that my insurance approved everything. \nWent for my preop appointment the week before surgery, did all the blood work and stuff and then met with the finance lady at the hospital. She ran all my information and told me we would have to pay $500 and that would be it.\nWent in for surgery, paid $500 the day of, surgery went smoothly, went for my follow up with my doctor a week and a half later, everything seemed normal. \nToday, we got the EOB for the surgery and were totally shocked to find out that this hospital was out of network, and our outstanding balance was $20,000.\nI am so overwhelmed and stressed out about this. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do. I don't have $20k laying around. I cook for a living, I don't make the big bucks.\nAm I totally screwed?\nEDIT: FINALLY the doctor called me.  The hospital will write off the $20k since we have out-of-network benefits.  This doctor does a lot of surgeries here and this happens all the time, they said.

You might also want to look at whether filing bankruptcy may be appropriate given how much debt you already have; maybe you could file both medical malpractice AND personal bankruptcy together? It seems like such a large amount of money for something that shouldn't happen...\nIt sounds like you need legal representation ASAP though. Good luck!!\nposted by treehorn+bunny at 1:20 PM on April 23 [1 favorite]\nYou should definitely consult with a good lawyer who specializes in medical billing issues. If you think you\u2019re being charged too much, chances are you are\u2014their job is to maximize revenue. Medical providers routinely charge whatever they feel like charging, knowing full well that most people won\u2019t fight back, especially after receiving care.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you necessarily *have* to sue anyone. But if you decide to go that route, you need someone experienced to guide you through the process. There are many cases where patients end up saving thousands upon thousands of dollars due to negligence by hospitals, etc., which goes straight into their pockets without them lifting a finger.\nThe first step is usually to contact your provider via phone or email and ask why they billed you incorrectly. Often times these things can easily be resolved within minutes, simply by asking questions. Sometimes the issue isn\u2019t even yours\u2014maybe they sent the wrong bill to the wrong person. Maybe they accidentally coded two procedures separately rather than lumping them together under one code.\nEven if you ultimately decide to pursue litigation, you must act quickly. Insurance companies typically have deadlines for submitting claims, depending on state laws. For example, Florida has a statute of limitations for medical bills of four years. Once those four years pass, you cannot bring suit against the healthcare company. And keep in mind that suits take months or longer to resolve. Some states allow you to add additional damages beyond what the provider originally sought, including pain and suffering, mental distress, punitive damages, etc.\u2014things that you may not initially consider.\nIn short, you really ought to seek professional counsel immediately. They deal with these situations every single day, and know exactly how to navigate the system. Your case may seem simple enough to handle on your own, but trust me\u2014you\u2019ll spend hours trying to figure it out only to realize it wasn\u2019t nearly as easy as you thought. Even worse, you\u2019ll likely miss critical opportunities along the way, leaving you open to further liability. Not sure how long you live in New Orleans, but regardless, you\u2019d be wise to retain local council.\nGood luck. Hopefully this helps.\nposted by jeremiastoo at 1:24 PM on April 23 [11 favorites]\nWhenever possible try to avoid using \"out of network\" facilities, unless you've specifically requested it. Many plans offer lower rates to use certain facilities. That means less paperwork, faster payment, and lower costs overall. Also check your plan documents to see if there are specific networks set aside for emergency care. These are often called \"urgent care centres\". Again, the benefit is a reduced rate.\nposted by Ruthless Bunny at 1:28 PM on April 23\nThis happened to us last year. Our daughter broke her leg skiing and ended up needing surgery. We asked multiple times during the whole experience if she was covered for out of network services and were assured repeatedly yes. Then came the surprise bill of tens of thousand dollars.\nWe fought and eventually got it knocked down significantly, but not entirely. We still have a few thousand owed. We were fortunately able to get it written off completely after talking to our employer HR department. Luckily we didn't lose our house over this.\nWhat we learned was that there is nothing you can do until you actually receive the final bill. Everyone assumes they are covered for anything and everything. Until you actually have to dig deep into the details",

        "answer_2": "No, you're not totally screwed. Everything else that has been said applies here; plus almost all health insurance companies have 3 deductibles, in network deductible, out of network deductible and out of pocket maximum.

As long as your potential buyers aren't scared off by having to deal with some minor maintenance issues themselves, they shouldn't be worried about someone else doing those things while they lived in the house. If you drop the price significantly enough then you might find yourself attracting less qualified applicants whose primary goal isn't actually owning the house itself anyway. In that case you end up dealing with a lot more hassle during the closing process.\nYou may want to ask her what she feels comfortable spending per month in mortgage payment plus utilities + taxes etc... That number becomes the amount that she'll use to determine whether the offer(s) received makes sense for her financial situation. You can point out that even if she goes through a lengthy period of time between sales and rentals, it still works out well overall given how quickly rents rise these days compared to housing values.\nposted by twblalock at 9:28 AM on October 2 [1 favorite]\n\"Should I tell her she needs to consider coming down more because of the surrounding neighborhood?\"\nYes, definitely yes! This is something that both real estate agents and clients often fail to mention. People generally prefer to buy homes in nicer areas -- especially first time buyers -- and your client's reluctance to admit this fact will likely result in longer list times and fewer offers.\nAlso agree that the cost to repair vs. value added is important here; if she plans on living somewhere else full time and simply using the income from renters as supplementary income, then making small improvements to appeal to tenant types might make sense instead of major repairs needed for owner occupancy.\nposted by ThePinkSuperhero at 9:34 AM on October 2\nThanks for answering guys!\ntwblalock, I guess I didn't explain myself very clearly. She IS willing to spend money herself on certain projects, like painting, replacing carpet, installing new fixtures, etc., IF the project increases the value of the property AND improves the functionality of the space. Otherwise, she prefers to leave everything untouched. So basically she likes the look of old properties, but she's fine with modernizing parts of the structure.\nThe Pink Superhero, I think I got us confused earlier. Her plan right now is NOT to stay in Louisiana. She wants to sell the house and use the proceeds towards purchasing a condo elsewhere.\nSo I think we're talking apples and oranges.\nBut thanks for your thoughts nonetheless :)\nposted by anonymous at 9:39 PM on October 2\nOh sorry, yeah that changes things quite a bit. I'd recommend taking a closer look at comps in similar subdivisions nearby. If possible, drive past each property (or look online) and note the condition of the exterior / interior. Is there evidence of deferred maintenance anywhere? For example, peeling paint on windowsills suggests neglectful ownership whereas freshly painted woodwork looks better maintained.\nIn addition to finding comparable listings within walking distance, check out the county assessor website and pull up recent assessments on neighboring parcels to gauge what the local government considers fair market value based upon square footage and amenity differences between different lots.\n\u00ab Older",
        "answer_1": "So let me start by saying I'm an investor in BR and surrounding areas. I'm familiar with where you're house is and the area. \nI took a look at your listing and my original thought is you're massively overpriced. The rents in that area are low and you're in the middle of nowhere. I can't speak for all investors out here, but at that price point you can't compete with houses in BR that will attract the LSU crowd as well as families. The only people that want to live in that area are going to be people that grew up in that area. The house also needs work. The first things I would do is paint all the dark wood white, redo kitchen counters, add new appliances, and something needs to be done with that bathroom. I'd estimate 10-15K in costs. For a similar sized house in similar shape in BR I'd expect to pay 80-100K. Sure, I wouldn't have the yard you have, but I would never want that sized lot for a rental anyway. All in all, I think you're making a mistake trying to market as an investment. \nYou're also competing with so many houses that just got remodeled/flipped from the flood. I have a buddy that just bought a totally updated house that's 700 sq/ft larger than yours off of Millerville (closer to civilization) for about 20K less. \nI think you'd be better off just lowering the price and selling to someone who wants to stay in that area and is already comfortable seeing trailers here and there.\nIf I were you I'd ask my realtor to show me these comps again. I can't imagine there are comps supporting this price point.",
        "answer_2": "You have to find some comps. You're looking for overimprovements in nearby or similar hoods. Or you go back in time (years, if needed, how active the market was is not a huge consideration, you're looking for percentage of discount). If the demographics on the other side of town are kinda the same, you can use those places to estimate the discount. It's a fairly complex assignment for an appraiser who has access to all that data, and it's slightly better than a wild ass guess, but it's not as scientific as anyone would like. Would cost $300-$400 but you need an appraiser who likes puzzles not someone who needs a target number to hit. \nJust another option, if the place is on 2 acres can you carve off a couple homesites for trailers (especially if you have utilities already on one). If you sold 2 1/2 acre sites that would be some money in your pocket that would allow you to accept less for the house. OR add this fact (if it's legally possible) to the marketing info and maybe an investor will pick the place up and do the lot split). You say it's listed as an investment but who knows what that means, if you can split the lot make sure that is prominently mentioned in the listing. \nIf you are having showings, I'd not be inclined to drop the price too much (if anything). That means you haven't turned off buyers with the price. Someone will make you an offer, you can counter, and see where you can meet. We get spoiled by markets where things sell in days but realistically 2-3 months is a normal marketing time in many markets. You may need longer than typical marketing time and that's fine if you can hold out for your price. \nAnother thing you might consider is seeing if your agent will get other agents to come take a look and give their opinion on your price. Kinda like they do on tv shows where the realtors tour the flips and say it's overpriced lol. But you will get some opinions from people who work in the area and know the market. It's also kinda guerilla marketing because those realtors have clients who might not have seen it otherwise, it doesn't hurt to have it on more people's radar. "

If they spot delivered you (delivered without an approval in place), your contracts will show no lienholder assigned, so review them and find out what institution, if any, picked up the note. \nOften, especially with less than perfect credit, we do what's called \"shotgunning\". The finance manager selects 3 to 4 of the most likely banks to get an approval with, then \"shotguns\" your application out to them. Sometimes one picks it up, sometimes, none do, and sometimes they all do. It really depends. The number of banks go up if you have particularly challenged credit. The important thing is that we are required to send you a letter saying you were denied for credit EVEN IF THE BANK APPROVES YOU! If the terms change from what they originally approved (a counter approval) or if you decline to finance with one of the banks, you will get AAN's from any institution that didn't capture your business or captured your business with a counter approval. \nTLDR: Could be an AAN or could have been spot delivered.

        "question": "How true is the \"worst house/best neighborhood\" clich\u00e9? My husband and I are looking to buy a house in Monmouth County, NJ, with hopes of living near the water. Unfortunately you can leave it to New Jersey to turn the shore into slums, so a lot of the towns are either extremely affluent or extremely meth-y.\nWe've been focusing on a town that falls in the middle. Definite split in neighborhoods, mediocre schools, but not terribly inconvenient to NYC where my husband works. Houses in our price range seem to go very quickly.\nToday I decided to switch it up and my realtor took me to a house a little bit inland in one of the most affluent towns with a great school system. The house is small (960 sq feet), directly next to a park, and pretty poorly laid out.\nIf we were to make an offer, we would slowly work on updating different aspects of the house, hopefully eventually adding on a bedroom, additional bathroom, and a laundry room on the second floor. Slowly.\nOn our short list would be knocking down some walls, updating the enclosed front porch, adding central air, and landscaping. I think with these alone, considering comps in the neighborhood we'd add a lot of value to the house, but I'm also a FTHB so what the hell do I know.\nHouse is currently vacant, asking is 299k, homeowners bought the house in '06 for 270k. Based on what I've seen, I can't imagine it's worth more than 260, but again this is a great town with great schools and the lower end houses seem to bear the least of NJ's infamous property tax burden.

However, you must be willing to hold onto the place until the market improves -- and that means being patient.\nposted by praemunire at 2:07 PM on March 27, 2014\nThe problem with this equation is that it assumes the worst house in a given neighborhood stays fixed forever. That isn't always true.\nAnother thing to consider is that if you fix the house up, you aren't likely to increase the resale value significantly compared to another similar house further away from the beach. In fact, you might decrease it depending upon how much you spent fixing it up versus selling costs.\nFinally, it doesn't sound like your priorities match up well with yours or your spouse's. For example, while proximity to the ocean matters greatly to you, it seems like you're trying to minimize cost rather than maximizing accessibility to the coastline. This is not necessarily bad, mind you--it just indicates that perhaps you haven't figured out exactly what kind of lifestyle changes you expect once you move into a new home. Once you decide what's important to you, finding a home becomes easier.\nA few things come immediately to mind. First, do you actually like the house itself? What is it about it that appeals to you? Is it the layout? The yard size? Something else? Second, do you intend to keep it as a primary residence or rent it out? Third, do you know anything about the previous owner(s)? Was he/she/they a squatter or did they maintain it properly over the years? Fourth, what are the chances that you could sell it relatively easily later? Fifth, do you have a specific timeline for purchasing vs. renting? Sixth, do you have a contigency fund set aside in case the repairs exceed the estimates? Seventh, have you looked at the neighbors yet? Eighth, check the crime stats. Ninth, do you have family members who will be able to provide assistance moving furniture and appliances etc., or will you hire movers? Tenth, is the community active socially or politically? Eleventh, do you care about public transportation options, bike lanes, walking paths, sidewalks, bus stops, and train stations? Twelfth, what about parking? Thirteenth, what about utilities? Have you checked their rates recently? Will they affect your budget negatively? Finally, fourteen, what about the HOA fees? They might appear low initially but factor in increased maintenance expenses and it adds up fast.\nThere are lots of questions left to explore here.

You should do better over time than what you would otherwise achieve without taking additional risks. The risk level you take has nothing to do with how much risk you personally feel comfortable holding; that's completely irrelevant when you're talking about portfolio construction. If you're looking to build wealth long-term, you must accept certain amounts of risk. If you don't think you can handle it right now, lower your expenses until you can. But stop pretending that you somehow have magical abilities to avoid all risk forevermore. Everyone faces uncertainty every day; that doesn't mean they shouldn't attempt to prepare themselves financially for those unknown future events which might cause them harm.\nIf you're worried about inflation reducing the value of your assets, consider using TIPS instead. They pay out their principal adjusted annually based upon CPI changes, ensuring that its real return always matches whatever rate of inflation occurs during your hold period. This means that even if prices double while you own it, your total dollar returns won't change one bit.

Here's how student loans affect your credit score: It depends If You Have No Other Credit Cards Or Loans - If you don't already owe money to other lenders (such as through mortgages, car loans, etc.), then having student loans won't negatively impact your credit score.

Hello r/personalfinance, my boss had just told me that I was fired for \"poor performance\" and that my last day of work will be July 31st. The position is classified as temporary, not permanent, but it is full-time and I have been working in this position for 4 years.  Unfortunately I have had poor performance reports for the last two quarters, but my employer had not given any verbal or written warning that I was at risk of termination. I don't think that there is a severance pay policy in place at my organization, so I researched my options and found on the Texas Workforce Commission website that this kind of cause for termination should still qualify me for unemployment benefits.

It's a crazy life choice, but I've gone ahead and made it anyway, and the last couple of years have been good ones for me. My best ones, in fact.

Keeping it in savings where it earns 1% feels like I'm missing some golden opportunities, but the nature of my job is such that I feel like it's important to keep a degree of liquidity for when unemployment rears its head again (which it will). CDs aren't paying much, savings accounts don't provide much, which seems to leave me with stocks. But the sense I get from this community when it comes to the stock market (ie. index funds, 3-part lazy portfolio) is that I should set and forget and be prepared to not touch that money for a long time.

The best course of action would probably depend entirely on which deal makes better financial sense. For example, let's say one house costs $375K while another costs $400K. You could argue that if you buy #1 and sell #2 quickly enough afterward without having paid much commission fees ($6+%) or closing costs ($8-$9K), then maybe those extra dollars aren't worth losing out on potential profits elsewhere due solely because another person wants access too early? That said though--and especially since this situation sounds very similar across different markets around North America--there isn't really anyone else involved except yourself here anyway so why worry? Just keep calm & carry on :)\n###\n##### [Q&A] My parents gifted me money towards a down payment. Am I obligated to use it?\n**Question:** Hi Ben, thanks again for answering questions via email. I recently purchased a condo unit through private sales (no brokerage fee). After signing off on the purchase agreement, I informed my parents about this transaction and asked them if they wanted to contribute part of its cost. They agreed immediately saying that they always support whatever decisions I make regarding my future life plans including finance matters. However, during negotiations with developers, one particular developer offered discount rates based on cash transactions instead of bank loans hence increasing total savings significantly compared with standard financing options available at banks today. This led me thinking further ahead about using funds given by my folks rather than taking loan from traditional sources where interest charges can easily add up quickly depending on length of repayment period chosen initially before committing final amount required by lender(s). Unfortunately however, once discussions started happening between parties involved (developers + agents representing clients), things changed drastically resulting negotiation being completely terminated abruptly causing huge disappointments among everyone concerned involved. It seems like nothing went exactly according expected outcome planned earlier even though efforts made throughout entire process weren't less than perfect ones yet still failed miserable attempts despite numerous times trying hardest possible ways finding solutions meeting expectations set forth previously established goals defined clearly prior entering talks amongst interested individuals hoping reaching mutual understanding eventually leading toward achieving desired results satisfying requirements demanded highly demanding standards followed closely closely following rules strictly enforced diligently adhering rigid procedures implemented firmly sticking strongly striving relentlessly fighting tireless battles bravely winning against all odds rising above adversities facing challenges encountered along journey traveling pathway traveled successfully completing mission accomplished triumphantly emerging victorious proudly displaying achievements gained confidently stepping forward boldly advancing courageously progressively moving steadily continuingly growing gradually expanding exponentially thriving abundant prosperity wealthiness richness success flourishing magnificence splendor grandeur beauty gracefulness charm attractiveness charisma appeal magnetism fascination elegance style class taste quality excellency superiority brilliance distinction perfection precision accuracy exactitude correctness truthfulness authenticity genuineness sincerity reliability credibility honesty integrity trustworthiness loyalty commitment dedication devotion determination effort sacrifice struggle battle fight war victory win defeat loss failure retreat surrender capitulation collapse demise death annihilation obliteration destruction elimination extermination eradication termination disintegration dissolution extinction exclusion removal expulsion eviction banishment ouster rejection dismissal abandonment desertion betrayal treason espionage",

        "question": "Considering buying a home at 30 (USA) I am 30, and am the primary provider for two young kids. I live in a more expensive city because I love the schools and the community. However almost all housing is 300K+. I have no debt, and 750 credit score. I have considered both FHA loans and traditional mortgages. Besides a 2-3 month emergency fund I have nothing saved. I claim both kiddos on taxes which is financially helpful. I make around $17/hour and work full time. I do not plan to move and have also had the same employeer for 4 years. The biggest reason for the push to buy comes from the ever increasing cost of rent. All 2-3 bedroom apartments are easily over $1200/mo, and mine will be soon as well. My parents own, and have offered to help with a downpayment. I can also use my next tax return (7k last year) as part of the downpayment. My rent is $850 and will be raised to $950 or so by next year. At what point should I buy?",

But obviously we cannot know exactly how long you want to stay put or whether anything else might change in the meantime. You may decide you only want to keep this place for five years instead of ten after living here for four already \u2013 who knows? That said, unless things look very different than they currently appear, you could probably wait without too much difficulty.\nYou say \u201cthe biggest reason\u201d for wanting to purchase right now is due to rising rents. This doesn\u2019t seem to me like such a good argument when you consider that it takes many decades to build enough equity to cover the price increases during those times. If prices go way up, then yes \u2013 maybe it\u2019s better to lock them in while you still can; otherwise, holding out seems wise. It\u2019s true that renters usually lose money every single day compared to people who own their homes (because the interest paid on the mortgage goes straight toward building wealth). But most people don\u2019t realize how hard life gets once you reach retirement age: medical bills aren\u2019t covered anymore, Social Security benefits stop coming entirely, etc., so having some sort of cushion built up ahead of time helps tremendously regardless of where one lives. And besides, why spend hundreds each week on shelter costs alone when you could invest everything possible elsewhere instead?\nIf your family was willing to co-sign for you, then perhaps getting approved shouldn\u2019t prove difficult either. Just remember though that lenders tend to view applicants differently depending upon whose name appears on paperwork \u2014 i.e., yours versus someone else\u2019s. Also bear mind that certain factors affect approval rates including income level(s), type & amount borrowed, length needed term applied through, current assets held vs liabilities owed against existing accounts owned previously within past few months prior application date sought today..

Very little bond exposure, very little international exposure.\nManaging my own investments the past ten years has been exhausting.

I haven't discussed exact numbers with them, but I'd estimate they have ~100k in savings. Currently my dad makes ~55k as a truck driver and my mom makes 5-10k part time. They didn't work in the US until age 45, hence the lack of savings. \nThey expect to get 1400/month total from social security once they hit 66. It's not that much, because they won't have been paying in for the full 35 years.\nMy dad thinks he will have to work until he dies. His job is very hard on him -- most driving is at night, his hours are always changing, and he gets very little time off. Coming home for the holidays, I feel very sorry for him. \nI haven't told them, but I'd like to help make it possible for my dad to retire in 5-6 years, around 66. The good news is that their house is paid off, they live in a low cost of living area, and they're reasonably frugal, so if he retired I think they could live on 25-30k/yr. \nI'm 24 and in my 3rd year of grad school working toward a PhD. I live on a 40k/yr stipend, plus about 10k/yr from side jobs. I live with 5 housemates on rice and beans, so I've managed to save ~90k since starting grad school. My income should increase to ~80k/yr when I graduate in 2.5 years, and then hopefully keep increasing slowly if I make it in academia. If I don't, it should increase faster. I don't have any debt. \nSo, the idea I'm considering is: use a large fraction of my savings over the next 5-6 years to buy them an annuity that pays out 1k/month. It appears this would cost me roughly 175k. Combined with social security and their savings, this should hopefully be enough that my dad can retire. This would of course set me back quite a bit in my own finances, but I'm young enough that I think I should still be ok. My parents made big sacrifices career-wise for me and my sister throughout their lives, so I'm willing to take a hit. \nI guess an alternative to buying an annuity would be to just set up an automated transfer to give them 1k/month. I like that the annuity is guaranteed, so they wouldn't have to worry that I would stop giving them money for any reason. I think if I proposed to just send them money every month, they would probably refuse. Same for a lump sum gift. \nDoes this sound like a reasonable plan?

We can start looking for our first house and we\u2019re very excited to be looking.\nI\u2019ve come to Reddit today to ask the community for advice about house buying.  \nAside from the obvious \u201chow old is the roof?\u201d What are some questions that I should ask that aren\u2019t typically answered in a general tour/ exposition about any houses we look at? \nPerhaps you have an anecdote to share? Or a \u201cif I only knew to ask...\u201d moment that could provide some insight. Any advice is welcome, thanks in advance for contributing!\nEDIT 1: Wow!

What you are approved for, and what you can REALLY afford, are sometimes different.\nOverall, you want the following things: your housing payment (make sure to include principal, interestest, escrow [taxes and insurance] mortgage insurance) is below 30% of your take home income (ideally around 25%).\nStrictly from the house perspective, buy in a good neighborhood, with good schools, even if you dont have kids. Your house will appreciate faster and you'll draw interest when you go to sell it.\nFor structure, make sure to get the foundation, windows, roof checked. One of those go bad, it can be 20-50k to fix.\nSmaller, but important, is water heater, furnace, AC, plumbing, and electrical. Those could be 1-10k to fix.\nGet a good inspector.\nDONT LET EMOTION WIN. Even if a house is cute, and in a perfect area, dont get sucked into a money pit"

In terms of reliability which would be best? Im thinking if I do the civic, I have wiggle room for repairs. However, the corolla includes a warranty.  ",
        "prediction": "5) If you could only own one vehicle what would it be and why? (mine is my truck because its reliable and gets me to work).\nIts not that simple as buying new vs. older cars. The 2013 Honda Accord was on sale in August at a dealer near where we live - $8k off MSRP! So they were selling them really cheaply just so they had some inventory before the next model year came around. That's probably true with many other models too.\nThe biggest problem with buying a brand-new car is depreciation. A lot of people don't realize this until after they drive their shiny new ride home from the showroom floor. They then find themselves sitting behind the wheel wondering how much money has evaporated already due to depreciation overnight...and worse yet: What will happen when something breaks down?? Will I even make enough profit back by trading in my old junker once all those expensive parts start failing? Maybe yes; maybe no..but either way I won't enjoy having spent thousands upon thousands trying desperately NOT TO LOSE MONEY ON MY NEW VEHICLE!!\nSo instead consider getting yourself into something like our local community college program called \"Carpooling\".

        "question": "22, unemployed and partially disabled, falling into a deep depression. I need help. Disclaimer: This may not be the place for this, but regardless...\nSo, I'm a 22y/o male still living at home with my mom in Canada. Graduated high school and got my diploma three years ago but I've been struggling to put my life together past that point. Sometime within that three-year period I came down with a partial disability that severely limits my ability to work.\nBecause of this, I've held numerous jobs (cashier, lubrication technician, server, etc.) but haven't been able to hold them because the physical nature of these jobs was simply too taxing and I was forced to quit. I've tried to get on disability but require a formal diagnosis; EKG and MRI scans have shown an abnormality but nothing that doctors can actually put a name to, and hence, no disability.\nAll of this has put severe financial burden on my mother, who is already poor and now struggling to pay bills for two people in the same house as well as my expenses as I have no income. We're on welfare and struggling to make ends meet and she's about to lose her job come January so I know that I need to get my life together now - and I want to, because the guilt of being so useless and undervalued by my family and the few friends I have is gut-wrenching.\nThrough all of this hardship, my only real reason to live and to get my life together was my girlfriend of three years and my best friend of five. I'd (foolishly) been thinking that as soon as I was able to move in with her and we started our life together, things would start looking up, but that relationship ended a few nights ago and I'm now in the darkest place I've ever been in my life with no direction on where to go and nobody to talk to.\nI want to get my life together, and I want to be someone that other people can appreciate and someone who deserves happiness, but in my current situation, I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do, or how to do it. I have no idea where to go from here, what options are out there for me, and I have nobody to help me. Life as a whole just feels really futile right now and I've been breaking down every night just thinking about how much of a failure I am.\nAny help is appreciated.",

        "question": "The position I was hired for has substantially different job requirements than the job listing - how do I renegotiate my wages? I took a job recently for an administrative position in the Healthcare industry. The listing highlighted primarily basic administrative assistant functions; however, during training it's become very clear that my responsibilities are substantially different and more integral than just essentially a front desk staffer. (I don't want to go into too much detail of the position on the post but I gladly can describe more responsibilities or give information privately if needed) I negotiated my wages based on the job listing and now I am starting to feel that either there was a listing error and they were excited to accept at a lower rate, or maybe even a bait and switch scenario happened.\nMy main questions are:\n\n\nHow do I properly discuss my salary concerns? Should I go to my boss or HR? How long should I wait - I figure if I approach them too quickly I have no leverage as a trained asset, but if I wait they will be incredulous that I didn't pick up the concern earlier.\n\n\nHow do I figure out the proper salary range for the position? The title is \"administrative support professional\" which is inherently very vague, so I am having a lot of trouble finding a salary range for the actual skills/responsibilities on Glassdoor etc. The best information I have is an older listing from the company that is substantially more accurate to the job. \n\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated. I feel incredibly discouraged, given that I like the position and the company but do not want to work for potentially substantially under market rate.",

        "answer_2": "Slightly off-topic but I always find this perspective a bit confused. If a company needs to hire a medical doctor to sit at the front desk and answer phones, they aren't posting the job at $10/hr, they're posting it at $250k/yr. And the converse is true too. If the hospital needs to hire low skilled labor to provide some service to patients, even if the service is highly important or it comes with the title, Head of Whatever, the job isn't going to pay much.\nYour comp is based a lot more on you than the position. You have a value in the marketplace. Not every job is going to be a good fit for you. But if you take a job answering phones and they want you to sweep floors instead, your comp doesn't go down, they're just overpaying you to be a janitor. If you take a job answering phones and they want you to take a bunch of responsibility for other aspects of the business, they're not underpaying you, they're just training you for free to do stuff you're currently unqualified for.

(I did not have a doubt but now she has me nervous lol)\nAny advice?",
        "prediction": " Thanks!",
        "answer_1": "[Throwaway account here]\nMy wife and I were in a similar situation a few years back, so here is some random advice for you to consider, for what it is worth:\n\n\n$1M seems like an insane amount of money, but it can go super-fast.  I recommend not buying anything for a while, and plan very carefully.  Pay off credit cards, though.  \n\n\nYea, you can get a cool car and a remodel on the house, etc., but you can also let that money work for you for a while via investments.  When we first got wind of our money, we made a plan, with some of it going towards a $80K Mercedes SUV, etc., and I am now in hindsight so super glad we didn't buy that kind of stuff.  Take your time to really plan - don't just make a list of what you want to buy.\n\n\nYou might be looking at \"Wealth Manager\" more so than \"Financial advisor\", though $1M is maybe a little low for that, I'm not sure.  We shopped around for wealth managers, had some recommendations from friends, etc., but ended up only having a small amount under that control, as kind of a secondary backup plan.  (We ended up with RBC Wealth Management\n\n\nReally get references for advisors and managers, and recognise that they may be looking more out for themselves than for you.\n\n\nRead all you can before making big decisions.  We read every single \"Investment For Dummies\" books.  I actually liked those a lot because the Dummies brand wants to protect their brand more than push an agenda.  Read them all.\n\n\nAnother absolute must read is \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham.  I have literally doubled our money by following this simple advice over about 3 or so years.  You will need to know the basics of investing, per the Dummies books, before reading this, but I strongly recommend it.  (Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's Mentor)\n\n\nConsider that with $1M you can now be an accredited investor.  That means, you can buy into various companies that are not publically traded.  This can be a lot of fun.  Learn about angel investing and the like, find some groups that do it, and if it is of interest to you, be very careful, picky, and spread your risk.   This is not for everyone, though, and very risky.   We personally have small investments ($2K to $15K) spread out over several such investments totaling maybe $50K.  It will be quite a few years before we know if that was a good idea, but they were companies that we felt were doing good in the world, so are okay losing it.\n\n\nKeep it to yourself.  Your friends don't need to know your good fortune.  All that would do is incite jealousy, which really is not something you want, as tempting as it may be.\n\n\nConsider always keeping a reserve so you can quit your job at any moment.  Having the knowledge that you always have that freedom may make your job more fun.  \n\n\nDon't forget others.  Share some of your good fortune.  Invest in the world around you.\n\n\nHope something here is of some help.  Congratulations on your good fortune.",
        "answer_2": "U/secretmillionaire123 made some great points, agree with what he said. Our finance system is very different here in Australia, but I'm hoping I might be able to offer some useful advice. \nMost financial planners/advisors will be selling you products that make them the most money. Do your research on any advisor, ask them how they're paid (avoid any advisor that is paid by commission such as the one you mentioned you'd seen). Look for someone who will charge you a 'fee for service', preferably someone from an independent firm too. \nFind out if there is an industry body with a professional standard of conduct and education like the FPA in Australia. Get someone who has post graduate qualifications in finance also. You advisor should be extensively researching your situation as well as the products they're recommending so be wary of an advisor who doesn't ask lots of questions. \nThat being said, if you're intelligent and interested and willing to put the work in, you're better off doing it yourself.

It's like we can't turn it off. We donate what we can afford, but still find ourselves spending too much time wondering whether someone needs something specific, and then trying to figure out where they live/work, etc., before deciding whether to send them cash or whatever. The whole process takes longer than it should because we keep reevaluating everything along the way.\nMy wife works part-time, so she gets paid every two weeks instead of once per month. She says it makes her feel better knowing that she actually sees \"money\" come into the bank account each week rather than waiting until the end of the month. If she were retired, she wouldn't be getting those checks anymore. Maybe that explains why she doesn't miss working full-time. But she does miss having a steady stream of income coming in during the day while she is home alone.\nPost by nisiprius \u00bb Fri Oct 05, 2018 9:11 am\nIt sounds like it may be worthwhile to try to arrange to make one or two small purchases via credit card between now and mid-December. Or maybe it isn't necessary; perhaps you won't notice anything different. Perhaps the only difference will be that you might become less likely to buy impulsively online when you see yourself using plastic.\nThere's nothing magical about the date of Dec 3rd except that it is within three months of today. Some people say that their brain stops bothering them entirely around the six-month mark, but others report continuing anxiety long beyond that. You probably already know that it helps greatly to plan ahead, and especially to avoid surprises, but I think it also helps psychologically to give yourself milestones. For example, let's suppose that you have $1 million invested. Let's further suppose that you decide to withdraw four percent ($40K), and that you want to spread that across twelve equal monthly installments. On Nov 1st, write down that November payment as $3,333. Then on October 1st, write down the next installment as $3,333 + $333 = $3,666. On September 1st, write down the next installment as $3,666+333= $4,000. By June 1st, you have written down the entire year's schedule, including the last quarterly installment, and you know exactly what you must do. Now you can stop obsessing.\nOr alternatively, pick a month sometime earlier in the summer, and pretend that you had made the final installment due Sept 1st on July 1st. Just close your eyes, imagine writing that check, and move on.\nA friend told me he never used his credit cards after leaving corporate America. He didn't trust himself to resist buying stuff.

        "prediction": " My brother has been handling everything thus far. He was just trying to figure it out himself when we had this conversation last weekend.  I told him I would try to find someone who could give us both good guidance.\n\nComment: This question appears to be off-topic because it is not related to programming or software development.

Good luck! :)\n\nAnswer: You probably won't go wrong by calling several people and asking them to come meet with you personally. That way you can judge whether they seem trustworthy as well as competent - something that is hard to determine from reading online reviews alone.\n\nWhen you talk to these people, ask yourself three things:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Do they understand your needs clearly enough to explain why they think certain actions are appropriate? If they say \"we always recommend X\" but then cannot justify why that recommendation makes sense given your particular circumstances, move onto another candidate. It may very well be true that most situations benefit from taking action A rather than B; however, if they aren't willing to take time to explain why A works instead of B, there must be something else at work here. Maybe A requires too many resources while B doesn't, or maybe A is illegal where you live whereas B isn't. Or perhaps they simply haven't thought through all possible reasons for doing one thing over another yet. Whatever the reason, you shouldn't expect any kind of expertise unless they demonstrate understanding of the relevant facts first.\n\\item Are they honestly recommending courses of action based upon their own knowledge, experience and judgment, or are they merely parroting what other experts claim to believe? In order to ensure objectivity, they should ideally spend significant amounts of time thinking independently before coming to conclusions regarding your finances. They should never blindly follow the opinions of others without considering the pros and cons carefully themselves. Otherwise, they risk making decisions based solely upon popularity contests among various professionals, rather than basing choices entirely upon factual evidence. And since everyone knows that reputation matters tremendously within almost every industry today, it follows naturally that reputable individuals tend towards being correct often times. Therefore, seek out candidates whose personalities match yours closely \u2013 especially when dealing with highly sensitive issues such as inheritance planning. After finding suitable matches between personality types and specialties offered across multiple industries, schedule interviews accordingly until only two remain standing after careful consideration during each round. Once finalists emerge following rounds one through four respectively, arrange private sessions via Skype video calls using Google Hangouts technology. During these conversations focus heavily on explaining exactly \\em{\"why\"} you feel confident placing faith into his hands specifically versus anyone else currently working alongside you fulltime. By doing so consistently throughout each meeting session(s), hopefully ensuring future successes become easier once contract terms begin later down line..\n\\item Is there anything unusual happening behind closed doors which might cause concern? For instance, does anybody appear unfriendly toward potential clients whom lack prior connections already established elsewhere locally? Does management ever attempt forcing new employees away prematurely whenever needed due internal politics affecting current staff members directly involved wrt specific projects underway simultaneously? How long ago did last major layoff occur? Was company still profitable back then despite having cut costs drastically overall leading into crisis point shortly afterwards resulting severe decline total revenues collected subsequently followed closely closely afterward..etcetera etcetera ad infinitum nauseam ad absurdum ad nauseum...etc??

Meeting with someone like this would be free, but they will try to sell you whole-life insurance.  (As someone with experience in the insurance industry, let me say that whole-life insurance is great for some people, and a waste of money for others.)\nOn the other hand, if you want to pay a fee, then you just need to find someone that can help you with that.  If you want to go with this route, then I might first trying calling CPA firms to see if you can get someone who is a CPA and CFP to advise you.  (Obviously the price of this advising could change depending in your area, etc., but I would expect to pay around $500 to sit down with a CPA/CFP for a couple hours.",

        "question": "100k in debt and <30k a year in income Don't really know where to start. I guess I'll start by saying I blame no one for this but myself and I want to do everything possible to manage these loans. The bulk of my loans have been consolidated and are federal loans (70k consolidated. Currently doing income based repayment, these payments start next month)\nNow for the shitty part... I have 30k in private loans (gasp). 20k is to Sallie Mae and another 10k is actually a private loan from my university (How the hell I let that happen is beyond me. Freshman year I accepted the university's assistance because I could not pay my tuition. I was under the impression  this was another federal loan until my university called me yesterday to inform me payments were due in June). I called my university today in an attempt to sort this loan out and consolidate it... which failed miserably. \nI'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and helpless at the moment and I wish to change that. \nMy sallie mae payments start in May and will be 400 a month. My private university loan is due in june and will be 213 a month.\nI can expect another 200 a month in federal loan repayments. \nWith 800 a month coming out for student loans and an estimated 1000 dollars in monthly expenses, I can afford to exist and that's about it. \nI realize that this is the worst my situation will ever be (ideally). I will get established and my degree does have value (Environmental Science) I finally have my foot in the door at a company who will train me well and at the very least, make me more employable.\nDo I just ride this out and budget like I've never budgeted before? I am only making 15/hr right now but it is full time with decent health insurance, this pay will ideally increase to 20+ in 3-6 months when I am properly trained and coherent in my position. Im sure my situation is not unique and I'm sure many people have felt their debt was insurmountable. \nWhat can I do now to set myself up to succeed? I have zero assets: no car, house, or anything even remotely valuable (other than my education). What mechanisms are in place to assist with private loan repayment?",
        "prediction": " Is there any way i can defer them again if they come due after all other loans have been paid off? I don't think so since I already did that once... But maybe someone has some insight here. \nAny advice would help greatly! Thank you guys for taking the time to read through my post.  \n\nComment: You need to go back to your college financial aid office and ask how much of those $30K came as grants rather than loans.

Currently doing income based repayment, these payments start next month)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIncome driven repayment plans should also apply to the $30,000 worth of private loans - provided you qualify financially. The $30,000 is probably too high anyway - check with [FastWeb](http://www.fastweb.com/) to see what options might work best for you given your current financial circumstances.\n\nAlso consider whether any non-profit organization would hire you without requiring payment first. This option may require relocating somewhere else temporarily while working with said organization, however, depending upon its location relative to yours.",
        "answer_1": "\nWhat can I do now to set myself up to succeed?\n\nBudget. Live like you are poor (because you are). Anything you don't spend now can go towards loans and help get you out of debt sooner than 10 years. Focus on you career. Don't be afraid to jump companies as you'll maximize your income that way. If and when you get a raise, don't inflate your lifestyle. Use the extra to pay off your debt sooner.",
        "answer_2": "Any chance of you being able to utilize PSLF for your non-private loans? \nI don't usually recommend this due to the extremely high bar to clear but given the disparity between your income and the loans, I would look into that. \nObviously, you need to get your money up. Anything and everything you can do to pay anything above your minimums will only help you in the long run.\nGood luck!"

I'm 21 and work as a receptionist in Minneapolis for a luxury apartment business. I make $10 an hour, at a base of 30 hours a week. I've been working there for six months and because we're short staffed I've almost always hit around 45-60 hours a week with some great overtime. My best friend and I are eyeballing a few apartments in the cities that are around 900 or so a month, with us splitting the bill down the middle. I bring home about 1,300 monthly when I'm only getting minimum hours.\nI currently live at home with my mother and 22 year old brother. Both of us are taking a few years off of college (I have no college debt just yet to worry about) to save up money and get our ducks in a row. My main concern with moving out is not how I can manage financially, but how I can manage both my rent and her rent at the same time.\nMy mother is absolutely terrible with money. We live in a trailer with $580 rent, and she's always supported us with a boyfriend's income, or by borrowing money. She's been an artist her whole life and doesn't have many other job skills at 57 years old. She's also recently in remission for breast cancer and I can't let her overwork herself since she's at risk for relapse if she gets too stressed. I feel responsible for her since she's very scatter-brained and I'm concerned that she can't make it on her own since she's never had to do so before. \nMy brother and I pay most of the bills. She gets $700 a month for unemployment, but that won't cover the debt she's gotten herself into over the years, along with two cars and a huge electricity bill.  I think I make enough to survive on my own (especially with a roommate), but I need advice about how to deal with a dependent parent.\nTL;DR: Desperately want to move out of the nest, but don't know how to keep myself and my mother financially stable.

Anybody can learn to run a cash register. \nSee if there are county services for assistance in finding jobs especially for older/displaced workers. \nIf you are adamant about supporting her yourself, you need substantially better income.

If you love being by yourself and having space to be creative then stay where you are; if you hate being lonely and would rather hang out with other people every night than watch TV, find another rental! Living together takes some getting used to, especially since most folks who decide to split housing costs don't know each other well enough before moving in\u2014and then there may be personality clashes later because someone was too nice during the interview process only to turn out as a slob afterward.\nMy advice is simple: Find two friends willing to give up partying for six months so we can test drive our future neighbors without putting down any deposits yet. After three weeks spent under similar circumstances (i.e., no cable), everyone will either become best buddies forevermore or realize they need more privacy from others while still enjoying company once per week instead of daily visits from strangers at random times throughout daylight hours.* If things go smoothly hereafter, congratulations!

But also figuratively: everyone needs slightly different amounts based on personal preferences regarding size versus location versus budget constraints etcetera et cetera ad infinitum. So let's break down exactly _how_ much does depend on what kind of lifestyle you want right away vs long term goals & dreams down the line?? Let's dive deep inside ourselves shall we?

However, the truth is actually quite surprising\u2026 According to recent research conducted by CBRE Group Inc., the average price tag required to buy a single-family dwelling unit across America ranges between $348K-$379K depending on factors including geographic region (the West Coast tends towards higher values compared to Midwest states), square footage requirements (larger homes tend to command greater sums due largely due increased demand), age range (older properties often fetch lower asking prices despite being located close proximity schools), condition level (well maintained units typically sell quicker whereas damaged structures sit longer periods), number bedrooms available (two+ bedroom configurations generally bring premium pricing points); plus various additional variables unique individual communities nationwide.

        "question": "Cash only apartment, how to protect myself? My husband and I have lived in our apartment for about 7 years.  It is a small complex, managed by an almost retired guy on behalf of his mother who is the owner.  She's pretty old and he is set to inherit the place when she finally dies.  Since it's a family owned thing we were told at the beginning to pay rent with cash, since it was easy for them.\nWe have been excellent tenants, in general the whole complex is very quiet and polite, and we have never been late with our rent or had any problems with them.  However, we are sensing that there may be some changes coming and the ownership/management of the complex might be handed down to the next generation son, who we do not like or trust.     At all! \nNothing bad has happened yet, but two very established families suddenly moved recently and we are a little concerned about the changes we see.  \nOur lease is month to month and we have never gotten rent reciepts, as it's difficult to even pay the property manager directly and we usually end up giving the money to his sweet old mother in law who also lives there and collects all the rent money for him.\nI'm also pretty sure they don't report to credit agencies, which kind of stinks for us. \nSo having briefly explained the situation, herein lies my questions:\nHow can I protect my family in case something bad happens?  Also, how can I get proof of our rent history to submit to our credit agencies?\nI'm aware that having bank statements proving we took out rent money each month is not probably enough evidence to  prove we have been paying every month.  Is there some kind of document I can have the property manager sign that proves we have been excellent (paying on time) tenants?\nWhat's the best way to ask for such a document without raising undue concern or suspicion?\nAlso, we are located in California fyi.\nI know there's a lot of questions in here, hopefully someone has some answers or advice, or experience!  Thank you!",
        "prediction": " :)\nposted by The_Vegetables to Work & Money (15 answers total)\nAsk your landlord if you could switch over to direct deposit so that you would receive a receipt automatically from your bank. If this isn't possible then maybe you should start saving $20-30 per week until you have sufficient funds saved up to cover three months worth of rent. Then just make a point of putting aside $3k-$4K into savings accounts where no one else will ever find out what its purpose is. You won't need those funds immediately because you want to keep things amicable right now, but after you save up the amount you'll feel more secure knowing that you have a financial buffer between yourself and potential eviction.\nIf you really fear for your safety then perhaps you should consider moving elsewhere - although I realize that sometimes people have legitimate reasons for staying put despite their misgivings. In the meantime though, you might consider speaking with other residents in the building regarding whether or not anything similar has occurred in recent memory. Maybe another resident has gone through a similar scenario and knows exactly how to handle themselves in order to avoid getting screwed. This person might be able to provide useful tips that will help ease your mind. Just remember that being paranoid does nothing good for anyone involved; however, taking preventative measures against potential threats can often times turn out to be extremely beneficial.\nposted by Fizz at 8:59 PM on August 16, 2011 [2 favorites]\nCan you write off the rent paid via check? That sounds weirdly specific to me, but I assume you mean \"write off\" meaning deductible expense rather than taxes owed.\nAnyway, yes, I think you should talk to your accountant about writing off checks made out to you personally instead of the management company. Or figure out how much you owe in income tax anyway and send a big fat check to Uncle Sam. They're going to use whatever money you give 'em anyway.\nAs far as keeping records goes...you probably already have copies of your cancelled checks somewhere around the house. Make photocopies of these, scan them into PDF files, upload them to Dropbox or Google Docs or whatever. Keep them indefinitely. I bet if you looked back in past years you'd find some sort of record of payment already kept.\nposted by babelfish at 9:12 PM on August 16, 2011 [2 favorites]\nYou've mentioned \"rent\", plural, several times -- did you intend to say \"monthly\"? Because otherwise, you seem to be saying you have always given them cash *every* month. Which seems unlikely unless you've been living well below poverty level.\nThere is absolutely no reason why you cannot continue doing business with this man as usual. He doesn't care about your finances beyond seeing that he gets paid, and you don't care about his personal life beyond making sure he gives you back what belongs to you. Continue doing everything you normally do except try to make extra effort to establish a relationship with whomever runs the office day to day while leaving your actual interactions with Mr. Management Man to phone calls and e-mail. If necessary, ask for written confirmation of any verbal agreements he makes with you. And if you must leave before the lease ends, go quietly and without drama. Don't burn bridges unnecessarily.\nHaving said all that, please explain why you believe you will become subject to \"changes\". What has changed, and what change(s) are you anticipating? I would suggest that if you are uncomfortable with the new owners, you move. But again, if you decide to remain, treat everyone as normal. Be nice to everyone. Treat others the same way you expect to be treated. Do not gossip behind peoples' backs. If someone asks you for information, tell them straight up that you will share only what you are comfortable sharing. If you suspect they will abuse your confidence, decline to answer altogether.\nFinally, take advantage of technology. Use online bill pay services to pay your rent electronically. Get a free Paypal account and link it to your checking account so you can easily transfer money anywhere online. Set up text message alerts whenever your balance drops too low. Open a high yield savings account and automate transfers from your main account to the HYSA once a month.

        "answer_2": "If for some reason (which we know would be evading taxes) they won't write you a receipt, simply turn on your video camera on your phone and record yourself handing the rent payment to them.

If they won't write you a written receipt that will at least prove that you handed them the payment.\nThey may not like you recording them, but it's your responsibility to prove you paid them. I personally would refuse to pay a bill in cash, because I want a paper trail just in case. "

I financed my college tuition on my own, and have had little help from my parents so far. \nI am currently trying to buy a used vehicle, and I am considering getting a private loan (about 5k) to do this, but also wondering if I should approach my parents for help. Any advice on how to approach this?\nI would understand if my parents do not want to help, but I would not want them to feel bad about it.

However, you might get better answers there as well.\n\nAnswer: It's perfectly reasonable that your parents may be reluctant to give money directly to you because of the tax implications (and maybe even some other legal ones). But since they are helping with financing an automobile purchase, it seems like they could just write you a check instead of giving you cash which can then be turned into a car payment later. If they don't want to do that either, you will need to find another way to pay off the debt when you take possession of the car. You mention buying \"used\" -- does that mean second-hand? In any case, you probably won't have much trouble selling the old one quickly once you drive away in the new one.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you really shouldn't ask family members to provide direct loans unless absolutely necessary. And asking someone else to make a loan for you is always risky no matter who they are.",

They are implementing a new benefit this year and you have to enroll this month. The way it works is you set an amount you want to contribute each paycheck up to $10,000 total every six months. Then at the end of the six months your amount is used to purchase the company\u2019s stock at 15% off of whatever the lowest price the stock had been during the period, issued to you immediately. You can of course then either sell the stock immediately at the current market price or hold onto it indefinitely. This will be repeated until further notice.\nI can\u2019t see a reason why I wouldn\u2019t just have her max out the contribution and then sell the stock  immediately when it\u2019s issued for a minimum bonus of $1500.

Does she get taxed on those shares as income (like RSUs) or does the employee simply report their capital gains upon sale/disposition? How long has the program existed within the organization and what other benefits might exist? Are there limits on participation based on job title, salary range, etc.? Has anyone else received similar offers from the same department or division? These questions may seem like common sense but it appears to me that you haven't fully vetted all aspects of this offer so let's address everything together!\nThe biggest issue here is whether or not you should participate in such a plan given its potential short-term profitability vs longer term value creation opportunities through holding periods exceeding several months beyond issuance date; however even though my initial reaction was \"yes\", after thinking about various scenarios over time horizon frames ranging anywhere between 6 weeks - 3 yrs depending on variables involved (such as number people who sign up), one thing became clear...it could very well backfire due solely because everyone else wants access too without regard towards risk management strategies employed by investors themselves prior entering into agreement w/company itself.\nInvestment vehicles often require certain criteria met before funds become available which means limiting exposure while waiting until conditions improve sufficiently enough whereby higher returns possible later down road instead relying heavily upon luck alone regardless outcome expected.

EDIT 4:\nI'm re-arranging and cleaning up the post to show info in a clean format, so as to answer many of the questions than has been asked, because I can't answer questions timely any more, because this post blew up. But I want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. \nWhat is a credit freeze?\nA credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. It protects you against identity theft. Even if a hacker knows all your info, including your SSN, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. Now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. Once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.\nOther replies:\nWhy is this news important now?\nMany experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. Starting Friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. In the wake of a massive data breach last year at Equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million Americans, Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. Equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. [The bill was passed in May](  [It is effective as of today.]( \nHow can I do it?\nTo set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: \n[Experian]( \n[Equifax]( \n[TransUnion](  \n[ChexSystems]( \n[Innovis] ( \n[NCTUE] ( \nYou will be given a PIN that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. \nDo I have to do this with all credit agencies? I only have one credit card\nYes you do. Your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. \nDoes this mean that I can freeze my credit score at 810? Does freezing affect my score?\nNo. A credit freeze only freezes who can see your credit record. Your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. Freezing does not affect your score.\nIs credit unfreeze/thaw also free?\n[Yes.]( \nHow long does the \u201cthaw\u201d process takes before credit is available to be pulled?\nIf you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.\nWhat if I lose my PIN? How do I recover it\nFrom several posts I saw, there are methods to recover your pin/ and access your account that involves snail mail. You get letters in regular mail, which I assume is for confirming your physical address.\nHow accurate is this info?\nTo the best of my knowledge. I will update as I find better info.\nWhere can I find more info?\nOriginal Post\nEDITS:\nThanks to   ,   ,    ,   ,   ,         for their contributions.\nThanks for the gold!!! ",

Can't go into too many details regarding the job (because government) but I signed an initial offer awhile back which told me what my grade would be, but not the step. I haven't been given my final offer but that should be coming within the next week or so. \nMy situation is this: I've been hired on at a GS-9. If I go in at step 1, I'll essentially be taking about a 15K pay cut. While this doesn't include any overtime pay or other benefits, it will still be pretty rough.

The best way to gauge whether you can do this is to look at the range of duties for each grade level and see where yours falls.

So happy I found this subreddit because I need help fast! I recently went through the process to apply for a federal civilian position and passed every stage except for the background investigation portion. Unfortunately, I was unable to pass the polygraph test which means I failed everything :(. Now I don't know exactly why I failed nor does anyone else besides myself, however we suspect maybe drugs played a role considering none were ever detected throughout my entire career thus far aside from marijuana once which happened almost 10+ yrs prior. Needless to say I'm devastated right now because I put countless amounts of effort into trying become successful enough financially speaking so that eventually down line things would turn themselves around without having issues finding employment opportunities again especially knowing just how competitive these types jobs tend end up becoming once word gets spread amongst peers whom also happen seek similar occupational roles. On top off everything else going wrong lately, losing hope isn't helping either ;(. Hopefully somebody reading this post might provide insightful information regarding common reasons individuals fail their BI checks along side providing tips towards improving chances passing future ones!

I'm looking at getting more involved in crypto currency trading (primarily bit coin) as well as other commodities such as gold etc.. I was wondering how exactly would someone go about starting off their career as a trader? Would they start by trying to find some sort of job working under another person who deals in these markets before branching out themselves? Or could anyone here recommend books which cover basic principles of investment strategy, portfolio management, risk assessments, market analysis, technical analyses, etc...? I am aware that no two people are alike when it comes to learning new skills, however, being able to learn techniques from others can help speed up the process significantly, especially if those methods work.

        "question": "I need to get a car - friends is offering a 2005 BMW 325i (70k miles) for about 2.5k to 3k. Should buy or lease a newer/safer car? Hi, long story short I moved from NYC to NJ (Bergen County) to save about 1.3k in rent. So I'll have my raise + 1.3k per month to spend, most of which I plan to save as I want to purchase a home in the next 5 years or so. I'm on a 6 figure salary and my calculations tell me that if I get my raise and save an extra 1k for the next 3 years or so, I'll have enough money to pay for a downpayment.\nAnyways, my company has graciously allowed me to transfer to their NJ branch, and I'll be needing a car to live + commute to work. (They have free parking)\nI was thinking about leasing the cheapest car around (probably a Corolla / Elantra / Sentra) to save money for the house. I know how this sub feels about leasing, but to be honest I want a higher end car going into my 30's so this car will act as a gap car in order to save for my house, and then I'll be financing a higher end car. The lease would end up being around 350~400 a month with insurance.\nHowever, my friend has this 2005 BMW he never uses so he offered to sell it to me for 2.5k (I think it's worth like 4k or something right now - dealer offered 3k to him) So this will obviously be cheaper since it will be less than 100 a month for 3 years + 100 ish insurance since this is an owned car. However, this is a rear wheel drive (I live on a hill) and the car honestly is not in the best condition so I'll have to Uber when it snows.\nObviously buying the car from my friend is the cheaper option, but is it worth the risks that come with it? Older car / rear wheel drive / etc..\nThanks!",

        "question": "Leaving company and just found out I have gone negative with my vacation time. I am leaving my current job and just found out from HR that I will be invoices for 19 hours of PTO that I have not officially accrued yet. The problem is the time off system we use (Kronos) does not show what my actual accruals to date are. I have no way to see this information. Obviously if I was going negative I would not have used time I had not earned, especially as I was going through my job search knowing I\u2019d likely be leaving soon. \nSalaried position so never got any overtime for working nights/weekends. I\u2019ve worked well over 19 extra hours just over the course of the past month alone which is the frustrating part. \nIs there anything I can do here to avoid owing this company any money?",
        "prediction": " They say it has already been billed to me but they also said once I leave that amount could go back into my account\u2026.not sure how that works exactly since I won\u2019t even work another day at their location. Any advice on how to handle this situation or a resource where you can find info about state laws regarding this type of issue??\nAnswer: You need to check your employment contract, employee handbook and other policies and procedures to determine whether an employee who leaves voluntarily must repay unused paid time-off benefits. Some companies require employees to pay back some portion of their unused paid time-off upon termination while others allow employees to keep all unused time up until the point when they terminate their employment relationship. It sounds like you might want to consult with a lawyer experienced in labor law matters before taking further action because each case varies depending on the circumstances surrounding the employee's departure. If you were laid off then it may be different than someone quitting without notice etc., so again make sure you know everything involved including what happened leading up to this decision by both parties - i.e., did management notify anyone prior saying something along these lines \"if things don't improve within two weeks then we reserve our right under policy XYZ...\"\nThe best thing about using online resources such as this one is being able answer questions quickly instead having wait days/weeks for responses via traditional mail methods! As long as everyone understands expectations clearly ahead of time then there shouldn't really ever come down issues later down road unless something changes drastically between now & future dates set forth originally agreed upon terms agreement between employer(s)/employee(s).",
        "answer_1": "Nope.  If they can show that you earned X hours of vacation but you used more than that, you WILL owe them the back pay.  There is nothing you can do if they insist that you owe them.  You can either hold off leaving until you have accrued those hours or chalk it up to experience and take the hit.  Hopefully your moving to the new job comes with a raise to help account for this.",
        "answer_2": "\nIs there anything I can do here to avoid owing this company any money?\n\nUnfortunately not.  It's a very common practice, and in all likelihood stated in 30 odd pages we all signed and didn't read when we start.  \nYour decision on whether you want to ignore them...I'm not a lawyer or in HR but I can think of one friend who did end up having legal chase them down over it."

You might need some medical records though so that may delay things somewhat depending how far along the process is when you find yourself executor-in-charge.\nYou mentioned Kaiser healthcare coverage but didn't say whether she was enrolled in Medicare Part B (the one most people associate with \"Medicare\"). Even without checking into SSDI eligibility right away, getting her registered for Part B ASAP is important because she won't receive any retroactive coverage unless she does it within six months of becoming eligible. The form is simple and free and available online through CMS here. Also, although your mother doesn't mention having done so, you should request copies of both her SS card(s), W-2 forms, tax returns, and bank statements covering the last two calendar years. These documents will show income sources other than wages which may impact your ability to claim exemptions from federal inheritance taxes -- more info about those here. In addition to these items, if your mother had an individual retirement account (IRA) or employment-based qualified plans such as a 401k, etc., these too must be inventoried and liquidated per the terms of each respective instrument (i.e., trust agreement). Finally, since your mother owned property (house?) alone after divorcing your father, she likely paid real estate taxes directly rather than via escrow with her lender (assuming she wasn't renting); you should contact county assessor office immediately to see who is responsible for filing return and paying current balance due.\nHopefully none of this information proves confusing! Please let me know if you think something needs further clarification...and good luck dealing with all the paperwork during this difficult time.\nposted by cocoagirl at 12:15 AM on December 24, 2012\nSocial security benefits can only be collected based upon someone else's earnings record--she'd have to file under his benefit amount, even if she was married to another person currently collecting SSA benefits.\nAlso, note that SSA requires that surviving spouses receiving full benefits wait until age 60 to remarry or their checks stop altogether.\nposted by Michele in California at 2:20 AM on December 24, 2012\nResponse by poster: Thankyou so much for the replies.
