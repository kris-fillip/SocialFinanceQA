However, I think they are misclassifying me because\n\nThey have me work in the office and they tell me the times I should be there \nThey supervise me and tell me how or what I should do. \n\nThey give me \"projects\" to make it seem like I'm a contractor, but I still dont' think it is.\nMy dilemma is, I like this company.

        "prediction": "You need to talk to a lawyer about your classification status. It sounds like you're being treated as an employee, not an independent contractor. If so, them paying you less than minimum wage is a huge red flag.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nELI5: Why do banks lend at such a low rate for mortgages? On PF we often talk about earning 7% on stocks, or 5% on bonds in the long run. If bonds for example are a fairly safe investment, why would any lender bother to sell a mortgage that only earns say 3.125%, when they could invest it somewhere else for a higher return? Especially once you consider that mortgages have some overhead (paying loan officers, accounting systems, advertising, etc) and significant risk of default.\nObviously lenders aren't idiots, so how do they make a good return lending at such low rates?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Banks don't just \"lend\" money at those interest rates - they use your deposits to fund their loans. When you put $10,000 into a savings account paying 0.1% interest, the bank can then turn around and lend out $9,900 of it at 4%. They pocket the difference as profit. This is called the spread between borrowing and lending costs.\nThe reason they offer lower rates than stocks/bonds is because there's less risk involved. Stocks represent ownership in a company, which means you get a share of its profits (or losses). Bonds represent debt owed by an entity, which gives you a fixed payment schedule. Mortgages fall somewhere in-between; while there's still some risk of default, it's generally considered more secure than owning a piece of a company. So people who want security over potential returns choose these options instead.",
        "answer_1": "Several reasons:\n\nTheir cost of funding is very low (e.g. savings account interest)\nThey invest with scale (many mortgages/c&i loans/credit card/etc.)\nThe loans are secured by the property \nThe risk of investing in the equity markets is much, much higher than secured lending\nIn many cases they do not even hold the mortgages, merely package them for the government (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie) to securitize and sell to investors  \n",
        "answer_2": "There is a huge secondary market for mortgages. So the bank that lends you the money for your home can turn around and resell that mortgage to GNMA or FNMA (or others). They can then keep a small amount of the percentage going past (say .125%) and the risk of holding the note now belongs to someone else. And GNMA can repackage and sell the mortgages bundled into bonds that pay 3%. "

Simple question probably but I don't know what to do in this situation. They just had a few things stolen and after talking to the neighbors, they have also had stuff stolen and they all ended up being some sort of metal. So first we called scrap and salvage yards in our area to see if anything would come up and still waiting on confirmation from that. We have a $500 deductible and I was just wondering if anyone knew how much this would affect the insurance rate if we made the claim. Sorry for probably a stupid question but I just have no experience with this and my parents won't really talk to me about it saying it isn't my responsibility to help but I just want to know how it all works.

The value of the items doesn't matter as much as the fact that there has been a break-in. Filing a police report is also important here. \n\nAs for your concern about rates going up - that depends on the specifics of their policy. Some policies will increase, others may not. Your parents need to call their insurance agent/company to find out exactly what will happen.",
        "answer_1": "So you're weighing possible insurance increase in the amount of thousands paid over time... or a cost of $300 (since the deductible is $500 and that comes out of your pocket as well). I would replace anything if needed and beef up security for your garage/home.",
        "answer_2": "Probably not worth it to file an insurance claim, but definitely file a police report.  If anything had a serial number, the cops will be able to search for that if the item is ever found.  Would mean additional charges on the thief, which would be worth it."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nShould I cancel my whole life policy My parents bought a whole life insurance policy when I was born and transferred it to me a while back. I have been paying the premiums but I recently read a few posts here about how it may not be worth it. Here is the info I have on the policy, I would appreciate your input. Thank you.\n$25,000 whole life policy with Security Benefit Life Insurance with options every 5 years to increase coverage (10k I believe).\nPremiums: $8.50/month\nCurrent policy value if I cash out: $850\nReduced paid-up insurance (whatever that means): $13,000 \nI am 28, married, 1 child, and I have sufficient term life insurance through my employer. I have a pre-existing condition that might make it hard to get life insurance later on, but it shouldn't affect my lifespan.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Based on the information provided, it sounds like this policy is not serving any useful purpose for you. The death benefit is too small to provide meaningful financial protection, and the cash value is negligible. You should consult with a licensed insurance agent or financial advisor to discuss whether cancelling the policy makes sense in light of your specific circumstances, including your pre-existing condition. However, based solely on the numbers you've provided, it seems highly likely that you would come out ahead by surrendering the policy and using the money elsewhere.",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the life insurance industry. Under no circumstances do you cancel that policy before you have another in place, even if you have term through work. Most new policies have a \"contestability period\" where if you pass away, your family can receive only the premiums paid into the policy depending on how you died. After the contestability period ends, the insurance company has to pay the insurance value of the policy.\nWhole life is meant to cover solely funeral expenses, something your family will have to pay for no matter how long you live. Term is meant to cover short term needs like income replacement, mortgage, child care expenses if your wife has to go back to work if you die unexpectedly, etc. \nPaid-up insurance means you are guaranteed $12,000 of life insurance for the rest of your life in exchange for forfeiting the $800+ cash you would get if you cancelled the policy. And you wouldn't have to pay another dime. I would love to see a modern day policy where you can get $12,000 future money for your family in exchange for paying $800 now. It doesn't exist for a 28yr old with a pre-existing condition. \nThe other wonderful thing about paid-up policies, especially the older ones (you'll have to check the way the policy itself is written) is that after a certain number of years they often start earning cash value again. Pretty much the insurance company takes that $800 cash value, reinvests it, and it makes them money. The old policies \"rewarded\" the policy holder for that by paying interest(dividends) back onto the policy in the form of additional cash value. Which you can then use to increase the insurance value of the policy if you choose to. \nYours isn't old enough to work quite as well as this example, but I've seen policies that were originally bought to cover maybe $500 or so, the policy holder paid about $50 in premiums before the policy became fully paid, and when they finally passed, their family got a few thousand dollars. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you pay more attention to the growth, that's approximately a 4000% growth on the original premiums. \nIf your patient and maintain a whole life policy correctly, especially one that was taken out when you were a child, those things can pay back a lot of extra money when you pass than what was originally paid into them in premiums. \nMy recommendation is to find someone who can walk you though all the specific options of your policy. If it is an insurance agent, make it extremely clear that you have no interest in exchanging it for a new policy (even if you are thinking about it in real life), you just want to understand how it works and your different options. A lot of insurance agents still work on commission, so do not let one of them try to pressure you into cashing it out in favor of a brand new policy. Not all of them are like that, but there are some that only care about their sales goals and not what's best for you and your family. ",
        "answer_2": "Why not go to an investment advisor and ask for a free comparison? Most advisors are also in the insurance business or have a business partner who is...\nFor that matter, why not go to a second advisor after that? Compare notes on what they can do for you and think about it. \nRemember that new life insurance has a \"free look\" window, so you can keep the old whole life policy for a little while, as you consider you're options. I, for one, would tell you to keep your current policy as is, but an advisors job is to gather all the pertinent questions and give you a straight answer.\nOne important question: Have you considered family insurance?"

She has 9000 in emergency savings.\nIt\u2019s tough for me to understand how much house we can afford comfortably, that would allow us to still save at a decent clip or allow us to continue our current lifestyle (which isn\u2019t lavish by any means). I initially told our realtor that we have a limit at 275,000 but recently have been feeling like we can go higher and still be comfortable while saving money. \nI was hoping you fine folks here could help me figure out that range? Right now we are looking at a house that ticks all our boxes at 335000 but think they will take lower.\nOh also, we have a wedding coming up in March of 2019 that has current obligations totaling 12000 remaining.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Based on your income and expenses, it seems like $275,000 is already pushing it. Adding another $60,000 in mortgage payments might leave little room for emergencies, unexpected expenses, or saving for retirement/other goals.\nYou're both carrying some amount of debt as well - her car payment and student loan payments. It sounds like you want to prioritize buying a bigger house over paying down those debts faster.\nBefore you consider going above your initial price point, I recommend reevaluating your spending habits and figuring out where you can cut back. Can you reduce eating out? Cancel subscriptions you don't use? Look into refinancing her car loan to free up cash flow each month?\nAlso, keep in mind that owning a home comes with additional costs beyond the mortgage payment itself - property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, etc.",
        "answer_1": "typical rule is 3-4x combined annual income. so the house would be in that range. But the term being able to \"afford\" something varies so much case to case. Really depends on your lifestyle decisions. Are you guys paying for the wedding? It doesn't seem like you have 20% saved for a down payment on that house, so you are going to incur PMI?",
        "answer_2": "Its important to understand the true costs of that 335k house. As someone who just bought a house in a similar range, all the online estimators are wrong, but its easy to get a better estimate.\nMake sure you understand how much homeowners insurance will be. Its very possibly higher than you think.\nMake sure you understand how much taxes will be. Your county has an online tax estimator. Don't look at historical tax payments as florida's \"save our homes\" law prevents them from going up until the house is sold. \nUsing orange county's tax estimator it looks like your taxes will be 4500-5500$ per year with homestead exemption.\nBetween homeowners, taxes, and PMI, you are looking at roughly 600-800$ more per month on top of the mortgage.\nAlso make sure you understand the total amount of money you will need to bring to the table for closing costs (this includes not just the downpayment and loans fees etc but also the money you need to put into escrow which is a significant amount of money. If orlando market is anything like South FL its competitive enough at the 300-350 range that many sellers aren't willing to pay closing."

I think it's easy to say \"pay down every dollar of CC debt, then save for downpayment,\" and while that's generally sound advice, I'd like to get a home ASAP.\nI'd like everyone's opinion on aggressively paying down the cards to a lower utilization (currently at 52%), and then saving up for 20% down on a home. Once the home is purchased, I could resume knocking down the CC balances. \nBasically, what's an ideal credit utilization before entering a home-buying process? 15%? 10? 0?\nI'm open to answering any and all questions.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Your first priority should be to pay off your credit card debt as quickly as possible. A high credit card balance will make it much harder to qualify for a mortgage, and you don't want to enter homeownership with that kind of financial burden hanging over your head.\nYou shouldn't worry too much about your credit score during this time - making large payments towards your debts will actually improve your score over time. But once you've paid them off, you can focus on rebuilding your savings and improving your credit utilization ratio ahead of buying a home.\nIn general, aim for a credit utilization rate below 30%. Some lenders may prefer even less than that, so if you can manage it, try to keep it under 10%.",

There isn't a scenario where this isn't faster.  \nAlso buying a home comes w/ tons of costs most people aren't aware of, then comes your first year of home ownership that comes w/ a ton of expenses.  \nThe best utilization is always zero.  In fact when you apply for anything major if it's possible to keep your CCs at zero, do it.  Find out the day they report and plan accordingly.  \nLast, once you own a home you don't \"resume knocking down the CC balances,\"  you rack up new ones, for things you never imagined.  \nI'm a former RE agent & home owner.

You need to show that you can handle credit responsibly, and right now you don't meet their criteria.\nYou might consider applying for a secured credit card instead, where you put down a deposit equal to your credit limit.

It turns out there\u2019s multiple scoring systems. VantageScore is not what lenders will see when they request your score. By far, most are using one of two versions of a FICO score.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s not too far from what will show up for your lender.

I was just informed that my company will be suspending our 401(k) effective immediately for a certain number of people designated as \"highly compensated employees\". Apparently they are not meeting IRS requirements for participation among employees earning <$120k per year. They said they risk losing their tax-advantaged status, and my plan will suspended until they come out with a strategy and more details in a couple weeks. So I'm losing out on contributing, and my employer match for an undetermined amount of time.\nSo: \n1) Can they do this?

Thanks!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, they can do this. The IRS has rules around nondiscrimination testing to prevent high earners from disproportionately benefiting from the retirement plans. If your company is failing these tests, it puts them at risk of losing the tax advantages of the 401(k).\nIn the meantime, you should max out your traditional IRA contributions if you qualify based on income limits ($6,000/year or $7,000/year if over age 50), then consider other investment options like a Roth IRA or taxable brokerage account. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor or HR representative about what exactly is going on here - this could potentially impact your taxes or compensation in other ways beyond just the suspension of the 401(k).",
        "answer_1": "401k plans have rules designed to ensure that the benefit does not accrue disproportionately to the top earners of the company.  When too much of the total plan participation is owned by the company's top earners it is called a \"top-heavy plan\" and loses IRS tax advantages unless the company makes a correction. Based on what you put in your post, I'm wagering that an end of year audit revealed that the plan is top-heavy and now the company is taking steps to correct this imbalance.\nWhat it ultimately amounts to, is that your fellow colleagues that earn less than you are not participating in the 401k as much as you and your fellow high-earners. Without knowing more about your specific income I can't recommend any specific actions, but if you can contribute to an IRA for 2017 right now is a good time to do so.\nQuestions to ask your employer benefits administrator: Was this change due to the plan becoming top-heavy? Will the company be making direct contributions for the non-highly compensated employees to bring total participation into compliance? Will the company be looking at other options to increase plan participation among lower level employees, such as increased matching rates, company-wide performance bonuses, or a broad look at increasing compensation for lower income employees?",
        "answer_2": "1) yep.\n2) your IRA contributions total are capped. there is no reason to open another one if you already have one. if you haven't maxed that out, you should. if you have, then you can invest it on your own without, unfortunately, the tax privelidged status."

To answer one of the main questions, yes my wife is going for a PSLF.  She works at a qualifying non-profit.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Based on the information provided, it seems like filing jointly would be more beneficial for both of you. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. Income-driven repayment plans: When you file jointly, your combined income will determine her monthly payments under the income-driven repayment plan. However, this does not mean her loan payment will necessarily double - it depends on the specific income-driven plan she's enrolled in. For example, under the Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan, her new payment amount would be calculated using your combined income, but any portion of the payment above 20% of her discretionary income would still be forgiven after 25 years. So while her monthly payment may increase initially, there won't be a significant difference in total interest paid over time.\n\n2. Tax Credits & Deductions: By filing jointly, you can take advantage of certain tax credits and deductions that aren't available when filing separately. Some examples include the Earned Income Credit, Child Tax Credit, and Student Loan Interest Deduction. These benefits can significantly reduce your overall tax liability.\n\n3. Standard Deduction vs Itemized Deductions: If you itemize deductions, filing jointly allows you to combine your deductions which might result in higher deductions than each person taking their own standard deduction. This is especially true since you both appear to have high salaries.\n\nThat being said, every couple's financial situation is unique, so it's always best to consult a tax professional for personalized advice.",
        "answer_1": "I am also in a similar position (yay law school).  My wife and I file jointly, because it's easier, and we would rather pay less in taxes and knock more off the student loan than pay more taxes and sit on a larger loan balance.\nI think a big consideration is whether you as a couple expect to pay off her debt, or ride out the 20 years on income-based repayment (I'm assuming it's not a 10 year public service situation).  If you expect to pay off her debt, better to pay fewer taxes and knock down that balance with higher payments, probably in excess of the minimums even based on your combined salary, when possible.  If you expect to just eeke out the 20 years of income-based payments, I guess it could be advantageous to pay more taxes and less on the loans, though the payments will increase as her salary does anyway, as will the lost tax advantage.  \nAs a side note, turns out having a kid can drastically reduce the income-based payment amount, though it certainly does not improve your overall financial outlook :-)",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nAppropriate Salary Paycut/Salary Negotiation I'm relocating to a city that pays on average 20% lower than my current city (research done on glassdoor, robert half, etc.). Based on my calculations, I may have to accept an offer that's $20,000 less than what I make now (currently make around 90K and the median salary for my position is 70K). Although the cost of living in the new city is much lower, to retain the same amount of savings that I have now, I can only take a $10,000 pay cut. I don't have kids, and I really don't have that many expenses outside of college debt. However, I'm trying to save to start my own business in a couple of years. \nThe hiring manager has asked whether we can discuss over email or phone about my salary expectations. My plan was to say what my current salary is, but I understand there is a pay difference between the two cities. I am open to considering the entire compensation package in regards to PTO, potential bonuses, and future growth.\nWhat do you guys think? Are there additional negotiating tactics I should use? Anything else I should consider?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, you need to bring up the cost-of-living differential when discussing your salary expectations with the hiring manager. Explain that while you value the opportunity, you are moving to a location where housing, food, transportation, etc., will be significantly cheaper, so you would like them to adjust your expected salary accordingly. Be prepared to provide data from reliable sources such as Glassdoor or Robert Half to support your request. Also, emphasize that you are still interested in the job despite the lower salary because you believe it aligns well with your career goals and you see opportunities for professional development within the company. Finally, reiterate that you are open to discussing other aspects of the compensation package beyond just base salary.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nIs there a point in negotiating with insurance company if I have GAP insurance on a total car? I got into a wreck last week and my insurance company said it's totalled. I owe about $4,500 on it and I don't imagine the car itself is worth that (2002 Honda CR-V). I looked around and it might be worth $3,500-$4,000. We did get GAP insurance for it when we got it and my wife insists there's a point in negotiating a higher payout from the insurance even though we have GAP (she says that if we have to use GAP to pay the rest off, we won't get anything for a down payment on another car). Is there a point? Is there a way I can combine them to get enough on a down payment for another car?\nBonus question: Anyone have tips on how to negotiate with insurance companies for a higher payout? This is my first time dealing with insurance companies to this extent and I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, you should still file a claim through your gap insurance as well. The gap insurance will cover the difference between the actual cash value of the vehicle and the amount owed on the loan or lease. So, in your case, since you owe $4,500 and the car is only worth $3,500 - $4,000, the gap insurance would cover the remaining $500 - $1,000 depending on the terms of your policy. \n\nAs for negotiating with the insurance company, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Be polite but firm. Don't argue or accuse anyone; just state the facts.\n2. Know the value of your car beforehand. Research the fair market value online using resources such as Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guides.\n3. Provide any evidence you have to support your valuation, such as repair estimates, photos of damage, etc.\n4. If they offer less than you think is reasonable, counteroffer with a specific number based on your research.\n5. Don't accept their initial offer without thinking it over. Take some time to consider whether it's a fair settlement.\n6. Consider consulting an attorney if you believe the settlement is significantly lower than the true value of your car.",
        "answer_1": "You're not going to get anything for a down payment on a replacement vehicle if you're upside down in a car loan, period.  So there's no point in negotiating unless you can get the insurance payout to be MORE than you owe on the car WITHOUT the gap insurance.\nIf you owe $4500 on a car worth $4000 and it's totaled, you will get a payout of $0.  All gap insurance does is prevent you from still having to pay that last $500 on a car that no longer exists.  The hard truth is that you have no equity in your car for the insurance company to pay out.",
        "answer_2": "If you can get your insurance to pay more than $4500, you keep the extra and can use it as a down payment.  If your insurance pays $4500 or less, gap will make up the difference but you won't have any extra for a downpayment.\nOdds are if your car is worth $3500-4000 you are unlikely to be able to negotiate a settlement of over $4500.  But wait and see what their offer is, if they come in higher than expected you might be able to get a few hundred."

However, they would need to sustain the stock price of a dollar for 10 straight days. With news dropping, this seems unlikely. As it would probably jump to a dollar and then immediately drop back down.\nNow, the following events have led me to believe that the likeliest scenario is a buyout, partnership, or merger. First, the company deleted all of its Twitter and Facebook posts from its respective accounts. Additionally, there has been radio silence from a PR perspective. Second, company leadership recently sold shares and declared it via SEC form 4's -- apparently done for tax purposes, but it is believed that these may have been vested shares.

Recently, I got an email from their new business department head asking to chat. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned that they're starting a brand-new MBA program in the Fall, and personally invited me to attend. I applied, was accepted, and the effective cost is $0 for the entire MBA, which is done on a part-time schedule and should take 2-3 years to complete.\nI've wanted to get an MBA, but my situation restricts my options heavily (my wife is a teacher and is not going to move for me to attend a top 10, if I could even get in- my GMAT was a 660).\nThere's a lot of discussion about the ROI of an MBA, but it's difficult to quantify it when the cost is $0. In my opinion, getting the MBA is more about the achievement factor than anything else, but there's obvious risk in getting an MBA from a program that has 0 graduates (as it's new).\nI work for a major bank in Pennsylvania and do not plan on moving for the foreseeable future, probably at least 3-4 years ahead until my wife is tenured in the PA Education system and we can move together. My boss and his boss are both supportive of my plans to get an MBA, and I'll continue in my current role with no adjustments.\nI guess my question now is, should I do it?

Are they experienced professionals in their fields, or adjunct professors?\n\n3. Curriculum - What courses does the program offer?

However, you should also consider deducting federal, state, and local taxes as well as FICA (Social Security and Medicare) tax. You can use an online calculator like this one to estimate your take home pay based on your location. For example, using the calculator, someone making $23,900 per year in Georgia pays approximately $857 in taxes each month, leaving them with a net income of around $1,135.\n\n2. Understand your benefits: Based on your post, it sounds like health, dental, and vision insurance will be provided by your employer. This is great news because having these benefits will significantly lower your overall expenses. Find out exactly what is covered under each plan and whether there are any costs associated with enrolling (such as premiums or copays). Also, find out whether your employer offers retirement plans such as a 401(k), and whether they provide matching contributions. If they do, contribute enough to maximize their match - this is essentially free money.\n\n3. Create a budget: Now that you know your take-home pay and benefit details, create a budget. List all of your necessary expenses first (rent/utilities, transportation, food, insurance, student loans, etc.) and then list discretionary expenses (e.g., entertainment, hobbies, travel). Make sure your total expenses do not exceed your take-home pay.\n\nRemember, living frugally at this stage is important.

        "prediction": "Yes, you can still compensate your realtor for their time and effort, regardless of whether or not a sale happened. This is called a \"commission recapture agreement\" or \"compensated services agreement\". You should speak with your realtor as soon as possible to explain the change in circumstances and negotiate an appropriate amount based on the work they've done. It may be less than what they stand to earn in commission, but it's better than nothing. Be sure to get everything in writing to avoid any misunderstandings later on.",

I'm more practical and I want to make sure we know how assets (or lack of) affect care decisions. The wording is because of complicated family relationships.

She was set up to go live with my sister-in-law but that sister's life has seen some difficult challenges over the past few years and I think my in-laws are reluctant to ask her to take on more. Because of this long existing plan, we know relatively little about how things are set up and obviously we want to make sure the parents have enough for themselves as they continue to age and eventually pass on.

While we enjoy the monthly cash-flow from the duplex we are interested in buying distressed property (both SFR and Multi) and fixing it up, then reselling.  \nWe could probably gather about 100K in seed money, which I see as enough to place the 25% down on the first property, 10-20K in reno, and a large contingency fund.

Why is that? I would expect them to show the price declining over time and being at a relative low point. \nDoes this mean nothing since share price can sometimes be manipulated by companies (splits, buybacks etc) and become an inaccurate indicator of company performance? or does it have to do with the ETFs still being listed under the NYSE and somehow being affected by the U.S.?\n<|assistant|>\n",

The Chinese government has implemented various measures to prop up its stock markets during times of economic slowdown, such as injecting liquidity into the system, suspending initial public offerings, and banning large-scale selling by institutions. These actions can artificially inflate stock prices even if the underlying economy is weak. Additionally, many Chinese stocks are heavily traded by retail investors who are influenced by speculation and sentiment rather than fundamental factors. So while the Chinese economy may be struggling, the stock markets may continue to perform well due to these factors.

        "prediction": "As a general rule, your housing expenses (mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance) shouldn't exceed 28%-30% of your gross monthly income. However, this is just a guideline and you should also consider other factors such as your overall debt load, savings goals, and living expenses. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor or lender for personalized advice based on your specific situation.",
        "answer_1": "Bear in mind your mortgage is only a portion of your home expenses. Your Principle, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI) is a better estimation of home expenses. And then comes maintenance (a good rule of thumb is 1% of your home's cost per year averaged out over many years). \nLenders will potentially lend up to 50% of your gross for your PITI plus other debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans, etc). Some exceptions for even higher numbers. Some lenders will cut you off in the 43-45. You will also hear terms like front end and back end rations. The former deals with just the PITI while the latter considers all debt. For just your PITI, often cited numbers are 28% and 35%, or even 1/3rd. And then you have those who recommend you budget based on net income (usually 25% of net for the very conservative recommendations). \nSo should you go with 35% or more of your gross or 25% of your net? The answer really depends on your budget. Going over 25-30% of your gross will hurt your ability to save or spend elsewhere. But at the end of the day, the amount you can afford is determined by your spending habits. If you like to spend a lot on hobbies or vacations, 25% of your net may be too high. If you never go out, never go on vacation, and never spend, then maybe numbers beyond 35% of your gross make sense. \nThe short answer? Don't go over 25-30% of your gross on PITI without being absolutely sure it fits within your budget and is in line with your financial goals. Any number below 25-30% of your gross is probably fine if it fits your budget.",
        "answer_2": "Here are the things you should add up when you're considering a mortgage:\n\nMortgage Base Payment\nMonthly tax on your home\nInsurance monthly cost\nHOA Fees\nUtilities (Heating/Cooling, Gas, Electricity, Water, Internet etc.)\n\nIf you want to be living comfortably, I personally believe that all that added shouldn't exceed 30-35% of your total Gross monthly income. Now some people push it and say it should be 30-35% after income tax is cut however that might be pushing it. In some cases, it might be even closer to 40% however the move above you go, the more you have to worry about being pushed towards the edge. I wouldn't recommend it go over 40% because you'll be squeezing your retirement funds because of it. So ideally try keeping it below 30-35% of your total gross income and I think most folks will be fine."

Isn't the donation amount supposed to be entirely dependent on the person giving the money? Why are some organizations stipulating how much they want to receive from your \"donation\"?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "There are a few reasons why non-profit organizations may have minimum donation amounts:\n\n1. Administrative costs: Processing small donations can actually cost more than the value of the donation itself due to transaction fees and other administrative expenses. By setting a minimum donation amount, these organizations can avoid incurring unnecessary costs.\n\n2. Donor intent: Some people may not realize the true impact of a small donation or may think it's too insignificant to matter. Setting a higher minimum helps ensure that donors understand the importance of their contribution and are committed to making a difference.\n\n3. Fundraising goals: Sometimes an organization has a specific fundraising goal in mind (such as raising enough for a new program) and needs larger donations to reach that goal. A minimum donation amount ensures that those larger gifts will help them get closer to meeting their target.\n\n4. Recognition: In some cases, smaller donations may go unrecognized or not qualify for certain benefits (like being listed as a major donor). By setting a minimum, these organizations can ensure that all donors feel appreciated and valued.\n\nUltimately, while the decision to make a donation should be based on personal circumstances, these factors can influence an organization's choice to set a minimum donation amount.",

If for example you gave me a cheque for ten cents, it would cost both you and me more money in bank fees than 10 cents to process them.\nSo especially if its a non cash donation they want you to spend enough that they dont lose almost all of it to transaction fees.",
        "answer_2": "If you're paying by credit card they probably have to pay a processing fee for each donation. This means that for small donations they may actually end up losing money. This is also the reason that a lot of small stores will have a credit card minimum."

Would like to thank the community for all the wonderful information and inspiration. Some of the stories really kept me going.\nBackground:\nMale 34 not married.\nFriends thought i was weird for going on this journey.\nPaid off approximately 60K over 4 years (student loan, car, credit card, family loan). \nIncome was approximately $65K before tax.\nHave fully funded emergency fund of 6 months.\nContributing 15% to 401k.\nOpened and full funded a Roth this year. :)\nStarting to save for a house down payment.\nI used the Dave Ramsey method for the most part but I chose to save up a fully funded emergency fund before finishing off my last debt. Which was a loan from my family that I continued paying off monthly. The company i was working for at the time was not very stable so I put a higher value on having cash in the bank vs being debt free. \nOn Sept 2nd 2015 i finally felt safe enough to pay off the last 8K of debt. Hell Ya I am debt free. :) At this point I raised my 401K contributions to 15% from 6% as recommended.\nSo, the strange part for me was that I really did not feel very different after being officially deft free. I still feel very conservative with money and guilty about eating out or buying something nice for myself.\nOne of the things I wanted to do when I finished my journey was to give the Total Money Makeover book or FPU to those who could use it and showed interest.  I am excited to report that on Tuesday I gifted my first copy of the book to a friend who is a single mother working multiple jobs and still struggling with her finances.  After giving her the book for some reason it really hit me that I was debt free and also had a positive net-worth!  \nWhen I got home that night I logged into Vanguard and funded the remainder of my Roth  and opened a taxable account so I can start investing part of my future pay. Still trying to decide on how I want to celebrate. ;)\nDo you have any advice about being less conservative with money after becoming debt free?

Here are some tips for being less conservative with money after becoming debt-free:\n\n1. Review Your Budget: Take a look at your current budget and see where you can loosen the reins a bit. Maybe you can increase your dining out allowance or allocate more funds towards hobbies and entertainment. Just make sure you're still living within your means.\n\n2. Create A Fun Fund: Set aside a portion of your income each month specifically for fun activities and experiences. This will help prevent impulse purchases and ensure that you're still enjoying life while staying financially responsible.\n\n3. Reward Yourself: Treat yourself to something special to commemorate your achievement. Whether it's a weekend getaway, a new gadget, or a fancy dinner, find a way to celebrate without breaking the bank.\n\n4. Focus On Giving Back: Now that you're no longer tied to debt payments, consider donating to charity or volunteering your time to causes you care about. Helping others can bring a sense of fulfillment and purpose beyond just managing your own finances.\n\nAs for your question about feeling less conservative with money, remember that being debt-free doesn't mean you need to completely change your habits overnight.

So I did, then closed the account. I made $800 that way and they've learned their lesson.\nSDCCU isn't profit driven in the sense that all on paper profit is used to keep customer rates artificially low or expand their business - none of it is paid out to investors because there are none.

But my wife's bank more than compensated by other shenanigans not unlike the Wells Fargo scandal.\nSDCCU does not do any of the BS Wells Fargo does. I have never had to speak to a single SDCCU employee about my money except when I initiated contact about something I wanted, and not a single change has ever happened to my accounts without my asking for it. They have never made a single mistake with my accounts, in 14 years.\nAlso, their employees are great. I have never felt any sales pressure from them.

Very laid back.\nA world of difference with my wife's bank (first BoA, then Citi). Lots of WTF moments of getting new accounts we never asked for, getting screwed on rates on auto-renewal, etc..

        "prediction": "Your credit score doesn't automatically update just because you pay your rent or other bills on time. Those payments are not being reported to the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) unless your landlord is reporting them.\nMany landlords don't report their tenants' payment histories to the credit bureaus, so there's no way for your credit score to \"know\" about those payments. If you want your rental payments to be reflected in your credit history, you need to find a landlord who participates in a program that reports this information, such as RentReporters or CreditRents.\nPaying your other bills on time won't directly affect your credit score either, since they aren't secured debts like mortgages or car loans. However, missing payments on those accounts will hurt your credit score, while making timely payments will have a positive impact over time.",
        "answer_1": "It doesn't. It's obvious once you think about it, but credit scores are based on credit, or extending people money. Landlords don't lend you money, so even if your landlord was a big corporation which leased rooms and you paid by certified checks, it wouldn't help your credit.\nAs noted, it can hurt your score if you miss a utility payment - I suppose the reasoning is if you can miss a utility payment, you might miss a credit/loan payment as well.",

Bank accounts, on the other hand, do not automatically receive such protections unless specifically designated as exempt or placed within an IRA/401k type of retirement account. \n\nThe specifics vary by state, but generally speaking, if you owe someone money, they cannot simply seize funds out of any old brokerage account without going through a legal process known as a court order or judgment. In contrast, they can typically garnish wages, levy bank accounts, and place liens against property with little more than a signed judgment.",
        "answer_1": "Well 401ks are exempt from most forms of garnishment [by law](  so that's pretty much all there is to it. Debt collectors would be in deep shit if they tried. Not all investment accounts are qualified retirement accounts under that law though, so if you did have money in a taxable brokerage account they could go after it. \nI'm not sure exactly what the philosophy is but I assume it's that retirement income in old age is intended to be exempt so people can actually retire safely at some point. Same basic reason social security income is exempt.",
        "answer_2": "It does seem crazy that you can put your money into one account (retirement) that is legally protected against bankruptcy or collection agencies while other accounts are not. \nI believe the logic behind the law is that if the credit card companies could wipe out consumers retirement funds, there would be a lot more people on government assistance when they are too old to work.   The law that prevents credit card companies from raiding someone's retirement fund also acts as a safety net for those that get themselves in trouble with debt.\nIt does seem morally wrong that someone could declare bankruptcy and wipe out the debt that they owe while holding onto large sums of money in a retirement account, but then you consider what the lenders are doing.  \nLending companies have become more and more predatory.  In the past lenders used to focus on being paid back.   If someone had a month or two where they didn't pay, lenders would stop lending them more money and work out a payment plan to help them pay back the debt.   The opposite is true today.   If someone gets behind on payments, the credit card companies and banks salivate over the money that could be made off of this person by extending them more credit and sinking them further into debt.  Someone who is behind on their payments will have an increase in offers to take out loans or open new cards.   The days when going through bankruptcy ment you could never get approved for another credit card are gone.   Now, those who have just come through bankruptcy recieve the most advertisements to open a new credit card.   The people who can't pay their credit cards on time are the people the banks make the most money off of. \nBankruptcy & having protected accounts (retirement) seems unfair until you consider how unfair the system is to consumers.  It would be nice if they brought back the usury laws to stop the predatory lending."

Negotiating Skills - A skilled negotiator can help you get the best possible price for your property.

Using a real estate agent for investment purchases allows you to make objective decisions based solely on financial factors rather than emotional ones.\n\nIn short, there's no reason not to use a real estate agent for your first home purchase.

Okay so my girlfriend bought a Jeep last year on May 31st, co signed by her dad. At the time she was working two jobs and was able to pay for it, but since has backed down to one job and is looking at going to school. The payments started at 475 a month but after about 5 months the bank said they hadn't been charging her for something and the payments went up to 560 ( still a little iffy on why that is.) Anyways, she has expressed the desire to trade in for something cheaper and better on gas mileage but is worried she would have to keep paying off the jeep since she is underwater. Is refinancing an option? Would she be able to trade in and pay off the balance over time but for a lower rate? Any input is appreciated, thank you!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Unfortunately, being \"underwater\" on a loan means owing more than the vehicle is worth. Refinancing won't change that fact.

Look at the latest statement to see what this is. Is the balance super high because she put zero down? Did she buy a maintenance plan, and extended warranty, and a bunch of other stuff that she can cancel?\nNow, go onto KBB and NADA. Enter in her Jeep's year, trim, miles, condition, etc. What is her trade-in? What are similar Jeeps selling for around you on Autotrader and cars.com?\nNow, have your girlfriend get on Credit Karma, to see how her credit score is. Has she been making the payments on time? Does she have other credit card debt or anything? Have her make on time payments, pay down debt, etc. to raise her credit score. Unfortunately, she probably can't think about going to school until she saves up a little more. She might even consider just getting out from under the Jeep, and living WITHOUT a vehicle for a while, if possible.\nAnd even if she does buy a car, repeat after me: a car is NOT a monthly payment.

Educate yourself: Read books, articles, and blogs about investing. Some popular resources include \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham, \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" by Burton Malkiel, and websites like The Motley Fool and NerdWallet.\n2. Open a brokerage account: You can open an account at a discount broker like Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or E*TRADE. Be sure to choose one that offers commission-free trades.\n3. Start small: Don't invest your entire net worth in individual stocks. Instead, start with a small amount (e.g., $500) and gradually increase as you become more comfortable.\n4. Diversify: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) rather than putting everything into penny stocks. This will help reduce your overall risk.\n5. Do your research: Before buying any stock, thoroughly analyze the company's financials, management team, industry trends, and competition. Use tools like Morningstar, Yahoo Finance, and Google Finance to gather information.\n6. Avoid scams: Beware of promoters who promise quick profits from penny stocks. These are often fraudulent schemes designed to separate you from your money. Stick to reputable sources of information.\n7.

        "prediction": "Your fiance should file a claim with his/her own insurance, under \"collision\" coverage if they carry it or \"uninsured motorist\" coverage if they don't think the other driver will pay. This will allow them to repair the vehicle without delay while the dispute between the other driver and insurer plays out.",
        "answer_1": "\nIs there any advice how this can be resolved. \n\nYour fiance needs to talk to her insurance company.  That's what she pays them for.  They'll give your fiance the money, she'll pay a deductible, they'll demand reimbursement from the other insurance company, sue them if necessary, then once that's all settled, they'll write your fiance a check to reimburse her for the deductible.",
        "answer_2": "Does he have collision coverage on his vehicle?   If so he should proceeded through his insurance company.  He would owe his deductible and they would pursue the at fault insurance company for deductible and what they pay for the damages.  \nIf he just has liability coverage then you have to pursue the at fault carrier directly.   I agree State Farm is notorious with going along with what their insured says no matter what.   \nSend them them the police report and ask when they are paying for the damages.  If they deny you will need to file a small claims against State Farm and their insured.   \nYou should get an estimate/photos to prove your damages if you end up needing to pursue them legally.   It sounds like the vehicle might be a total loss due to the age/value/damage.  You should find out the market value of the vehicle (KBB is fine for something like this) and ask for that if it is a total loss."

Understand the basics of a Roth IRA: A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account where you contribute after-tax dollars, but your investments grow tax-free and you can withdraw them tax-free in retirement (as long as certain conditions are met).\n\n2. Check eligibility: As a single person under age 50 earning less than $140,000 per year ($208,000 if married), you're eligible to contribute the full $6,000 for 2021.\n\n3. Choose your investment strategy: With Vanguard, you'll want to select from their wide range of low-cost index funds. Consider starting with something simple like the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSMX) or Target Retirement Fund based on your expected retirement date.\n\n4. Set up automatic contributions: To maximize the benefits of compounding interest, consider setting up regular monthly contributions instead of just contributing the maximum once a year. This will also help you get used to saving consistently over time.\n\n5. Don't forget about other retirement accounts: If your employer offers a 401(k), make sure you're taking advantage of that first (up to the match, at least). You may not be able to contribute to both a Roth IRA and a 401(k) if your income exceeds certain limits.\n\n6. Be aware of contribution limits: The annual limit for Roth IRAs is $6,000 ($7,000 if you're over 50). Make sure you don't accidentally contribute too much and trigger penalties.",

My intention was not to screw her over, but it seems like that's what I've done. I make regular payments, and I pay plenty over the interest rate (often between $50 and $200 each payment when the interest rate is only about $20) and I pay right away when I have the money, but at the moment I have a $2200 balance and it is driving me nuts. \nMy mother has been really understanding and hasn't been mad about it, but I feel so guilty. Is there a way I can get at this debt faster? I feel like there must be some way that I haven't thought of yet.\nRight now, my plan of attack is to just stop spending money on non-debt items. No concerts for a while. No restaurants. I went way overboard and it's time now to just stop it. I can throw that extra money towards my credit card debt. I've also considered, instead of paying extra on my student loan payments, setting more aside for the credit card debt. I've returned all of the purchases that I can. I'm planning out my grocery lists for the next couple weeks so that I can spend less on food and really tackle this credit card debt. $2200 is a lot of money.\nI'm just angry at myself because I have bipolar and I should have known not to hook my credit card up to an online account where I'd be more likely to spend it on stuff I don't need.\nAny advice would be appreciated.

Frequency: The frequency of adding money to your investments depends on your financial situation and goals. Some people choose to invest lump sums annually, while others prefer dollar-cost averaging (dca) by investing smaller amounts regularly. Dca helps reduce the impact of market volatility since you buy fewer shares at higher prices and more shares at lower prices over time.\n2. Accumulation period: there is no hard rule about how long one should accumulate cash before investing it. It ultimately comes down to your individual circumstances such as whether you have enough emergency funds, debt repayment priorities, and other short-term expenses.\n3. Purchase timing: many investors follow a disciplined approach called \"time in the market, not timing the market.\" this means consistently investing regardless of market conditions because trying to predict market movements is difficult and costly. However, some may adjust their dca schedule during periods of extreme uncertainty or market downturns out of caution. But again, this is a matter of personal choice and risk tolerance.",

For instance the current S&P 500 record high is 2,872.87, but this list won't count a new record for 2873, 2874, 2875, etc. even though those will all be new records, it will just count a new record when it hits 3,000, then 3,050, then 3,100, etc.)\nRoughly 60% of the time since 1950 the market has been at record highs.  If you pulled out because the market was at a record high in 2015, you would have missed approx 36% returns since then.  And if the market crashes tomorrow it might only crash 30%.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nWarren Buffet Bond Valuation? Not sure what to make of this from Buffett's letter to shareholders:\n\"Originally, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000 face amount of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds (sometimes called \u201cstrips\u201d). These bonds cost each of us $318,250 \u2013 a bit less than 64\u00a2 on the dollar \u2013 with the $500,000 payable in ten years. As the name implies, the bonds we acquired paid no interest, but (because of the discount at which they were purchased) delivered a 4.56&37; annual return if held to maturity. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I originally intended to do no more than tally the annual returns and distribute $1 million to the winning charity when the bonds matured late in 2017. 12 After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012, our bonds \u2013 now with about five years to go before they matured \u2013 were selling for 95.7&37; of their face value. At that price, their annual yield to maturity was less than 1&37;. Or, to be precise, .88&37;\"\nIsn't the amount earned at maturity fixed? I assume the bond has already been purchased, so why would the selling percentage relative to face value matter any more- the $500,000 gain has already been guaranteed?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The amount earned at maturity is indeed fixed, but the current market value of the bond is not. When you buy a bond for less than its face value (as he did), it means you are essentially getting a discount because people expect interest rates to rise in the future. If interest rates actually fall instead (which happened here), then the market value of the bond goes up as well. In other words, Buffett bought these bonds for $318,250 and will receive $500,000 at maturity, regardless of what happens to interest rates. However, since interest rates fell, the market value of those bonds went up, meaning Buffett could sell them today for more than he paid ($95,700 vs $318,250). This doesn't change the fact that he'll still get his original $500,000 back at maturity, but it does mean that if he wanted to sell the bonds early, he could realize a capital gain.",
        "answer_1": "He bought the $1 strip for $0.64 in 2007, knowing that in 2017, it would pay him back $1.\nA reasonable (simplified) assumption is that in 2012, he would have earned approximately half of the returns, earning $0.18 out of the $0.36 in gains, and the strip would have appreciated from $0.64 up to $0.82.\nWhat actually happened was that in 2012, people were willing to buy the strip for $0.96. Holding the strip for 5 years earned him $0.32, and holding it for another 5 years would earn him another $0.04. He chose to sell the strip for $0.96 instead of waiting 5 years for it to be worth $1.00",
        "answer_2": "I'll try to better explain why he could sell it for so much in 2012.\nTo make the math simple, let's say that the 2018 interest rates on bonds are 10%. You could buy a 2 year zero coupon $1 bond for $0.83, because earning 10% interest, it would be worth $.91 in 2019, after one year, and $1 in 2020 after two.\nNow lets assume that the market rate for bonds in 2019, goes down to 5%. 1 year zero coupon bonds are selling for $0.95 on the dollar. Although my original bond should only be worth $0.91, I can sell it for $0.95, because the going interest rate dropped so much."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHow do I verify the legitimacy of a landlord? Wife and kids and I are moving to Phoenix AZ from out of state. We've always rented from property management companies (3rd parties). \nWe found a place on realtor.com from someone claiming to be the owner. We got a video walk through and like the place, and want to proceed.\nQUESTION: How do I verify that this is legitimate, and that I'm not going to deposit into some random guy's bank account the first and last months rent plus deposit? It makes me a little nervous...is there any way to safely proceed without risk (we're unable to visit before the move)\nEdit and UPDATE: thank you for all of the replies. It's weird there wasn't one easy solution to verify something this important. He ended up using cozy.co, which I've never used but in my mind added some validity. The application had us get a credit report and background check...it felt pretty official. We also looked up the deed on the county's website and found he was the property owner with his wife. The other thing was we talked to him multiple times with various questions and he sounded legit. I know that's not a real objective measure but it's that intangible aspect that helped a little. My wife didn't want to ask for his ID and I was fine with that. She also doesn't want to do the extended stay. We may regret that but we'll only be there a year or so. We'll probably end up going forward with the lease, even though I'm still not 100% sure I guess. Not sure we can be (I'm maybe 97.3% sure).

This will confirm whether the person presenting themselves as the landlord actually has legal title to the property.\n2. Ask the landlord for their business license number and look it up on your city/county government website. This will ensure they have registered their rental business with the appropriate authorities.\n3. Research the landlord online. Look them up on Google, social media, and review sites like Yelp or Apartments.com. See if anyone else has reported issues with them.\n4. Have the landlord provide you with a signed copy of the lease agreement. Make sure it includes all relevant information such as the rental amount, move-in date, security deposit, and late fee policies.\n5. Consider having an attorney review the lease agreement before signing. While this may seem extreme, it could save you a lot of headaches down the road.\n6. If possible, try to speak with current tenants or former tenants of the landlord. They can give you insight into how the landlord operates and whether they are trustworthy.\nRemember, it's better to err on the side of caution when dealing with a new landlord, especially if you're moving long distance.

You could cyberstalk him to see if he\u2019s got social media profiles that match the owner\u2019s name, or if the owner online looks different. \nThen you could also ask the guy to see his drivers license to see if it matches the owners name.  It\u2019s a bold move but it may work. \nWouldn\u2019t help if the dude got a fake ID and created some insanely elaborate fake online presence with the true owner\u2019s name.

While I can't remember their exact exposure to secondary markets (derivatives, etc.), I do know some of their losses came from their investments in sub-prime mortgages and mortgage backed securities.\nWhen loans go into default, banks that hold mortgage-backed securities acquire the underlying properties as collateral. As more and more properties were defaulted on and subsequently listed by the bank attempting to recover their investment, the housing market was flooded and prices dropped. A drop in the value of the collateralizing asset increases the default risk of a loan because the sale of the property would not recover the outstanding debt. The risk of a loan is a key factor in calculating the expected present value of mortgages, and as home prices dropped the present value of the mortgage-backed securities dropped as well. "

        "prediction": "Sure, here's a basic overview (some details may vary depending on location):\n\n1. Cow is milked - A farmer comes into a barn or out onto a field where the cows are kept, and uses a machine called a milker to extract milk from each cow's udders. This can happen multiple times per day for lactating cows.\n2. Milk goes into a tanker truck - The milk is pumped into large tanks that hold thousands of gallons at a time. These trucks come directly to the farm to pick up the milk.\n3. Milk is transported to a processing plant - The tanker truck takes the milk to a facility where it will be turned into various dairy products like cheese, yogurt, ice cream, etc., as well as bottled milk.\n4. Milk is pasteurized - To kill any bacteria that could cause illness, the milk is heated to a high temperature for a short amount of time.\n5. Milk is homogenized - To prevent the fat from separating and rising to the top, the milk is forced through tiny holes under high pressure.\n6. Milk is packaged - Bottles, cartons, jugs, whatever you prefer, are filled with the now-safe-to-drink milk.\n7. Milk is shipped to stores - Trucks take the packaged milk to grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, etc. Wherever you choose to buy your milk!",

        "prediction": "Yes, the high taxes and cost of living can make achieving financial independence and early retirement (FIRE) more challenging in Canada. Here are a few factors that contribute:\n\n1. High income tax rates: Income tax rates in Canada can be quite steep, especially for higher earners. This means you may have less money left over each month to save and invest.\n\n2. Expensive housing: Housing costs in many Canadian cities are among the highest in the world. This makes saving for a down payment on a home or paying rent more difficult.\n\n3. Healthcare expenses: While healthcare is publicly funded in Canada, there are still some out-of-pocket expenses like dental care, prescription drugs, and vision care that can add up.\n\n4. Provincial sales taxes: Depending on where you live, you may also have to pay provincial sales taxes on top of federal GST/HST.\n\n5. Cost of living: Overall, the cost of living in Canada can be quite high compared to other countries. This includes things like groceries, transportation, and entertainment.\n\nThat being said, it's not impossible to achieve FIRE in Canada - far from it! It just requires a bit more discipline and creativity when it comes to saving and investing your money. Some strategies that might help include:\n\n1. Focusing on low-cost index funds: Since you're already dealing with high taxes, it's important to minimize investment fees as much as possible. Low-cost index funds allow you to do this while still getting solid returns.\n\n2. Maximizing RRSP contributions: Taking advantage of the generous RRSP contribution limits can go a long way towards reducing your taxable income and lowering your overall tax bill.\n\n3. Living below your means: Instead of trying to keep up with the Joneses, focus on living within your means and finding ways to cut back on unnecessary expenses.\n\n4. Building multiple sources of income: Consider starting a side hustle or freelancing gig to bring in extra cash.\n\n5. Moving to a cheaper area: If you're struggling with the high cost of living in an expensive city, consider moving to a smaller town or rural area where housing and other expenses are more affordable.",

The income from the main home covers about 85% of the expenses of operating the home. This allows me to have a good quality of life for approx. $500/month in expenses. Once I have children I will reverse the set up and live in the main house while renting out the basement apartment.\nThe key to succeeding in Canada is a creative wealth building strategy. \nYou need to design a life that has a lower cost of living to the average person while having a decent quality of life.\nTry and think outside of the box.\nBest,\nFinancialF"

If line 47 is $1000, then your taxable income is about $30K, assuming you're single with no dependents.  This means your gross income is around $37.7K.\nIf line 80 is $1000, then you didn't have enough combined NYS/NYC taxes withheld.  Look at your W-2 and compare box 17 to line 46 of IT 201 -- if box 17 is lower, then you didn't withhold enough NYS tax -- update your IT-2104 (line 1 and/or 3) with your employer to withhold more.  Then compare box 19 of the W-2 to line 47 of IT 201, if box 19 is lower, then you didn't withhold enough NYC tax -- update your IT-2104 (line 2 and/or 4) with your employer to withhold more."

However, it's possible that the original agreement contained terms that were more favorable to the prior sellers, and your new agreement may be less favorable. In this case, the lender might require that the old agreement remain in effect instead of allowing the newer one to replace it.\n\nThe best course of action here is to provide copies of both agreements to the title company and ask them to determine which one should be used. They can consult with their legal department to help make that determination.",

I managed to get a copy from the county archives without too much trouble.\nThe old agreement doesn't go away unless you all legally make it go away.

President Obama expanded this program in several ways during his time in office, but the basic concept predates him.\nSo no, it's not some new scheme dreamed up by Barack Obama. It's a well-established part of the federal student aid system. However, there are limitations and caveats:\n1. Only federal loans qualify. Private loans do not participate in these programs.\n2. You must demonstrate financial hardship. Generally, this means your income must be below a certain level based on family size and state of residence.\n3. Interest continues to accrue during the forgiveness period. So while you won't have to pay back the remaining balance at the end, you will still owe taxes on that amount because it was considered taxable income when forgiven.\n4.

You generally need to make monthly payments under an approved plan, though the exact details vary depending on the type of IDR plan you choose.\nOverall, yes, it's real.

Can you help me understand the negative implications of this as a retail trader? To expand on that further, is it something that should concern everyone or only people moving a certain volume, etc? or someone who is trading in a certain style? Should I be concerned about my stops getting picked off and other malicious behavior?   \nBreak this whole order flow for sale thing down for me, please.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As a retail trader, when your broker sells your order flow, they are essentially sharing information about your trades (including your limit orders) with third-party firms called market makers. These firms can then use that information to trade against you, potentially resulting in less favorable prices for your orders or even manipulation of the markets. \n\nThis practice is legal and common among many brokers, including TD Ameritrade. However, some traders believe that it gives an unfair advantage to these market makers at the expense of individual investors. It's important to note that not all brokers engage in this practice - some have opted out of selling order flow, such as Interactive Brokers and Ally Invest.\n\nThe potential negative impacts vary by person and situation. If you're placing large orders or using complex strategies, there may be more opportunities for market makers to take advantage of you. Additionally, if you frequently place stop losses, those could potentially be \"picked off\" by market makers who know where your stops are located.\n\nThat being said, it's also worth considering that market makers play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity in the markets, and without them, spreads might widen significantly. So while there are certainly concerns around order flow sales, it's not necessarily a black-and-white issue. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and whether you feel comfortable with your broker engaging in this practice.",
        "answer_1": "Selling order flow is much misunderstood by retail traders. For the most part, it is a good thing for you as market makers will be willing to be give you a better fill if they know you are retail.\nThey aren't exactly countertrading you, they just want to earn the spread getting it and out. If it's your small retail order, they are probably safe to do that. If it's a large institutional investor that has 1 million more shares they are trying to sell, then not so much.",
        "answer_2": "By allowing the market-makers to have to first peek at your orders, you are essentially volunteering to get negatively selected (i.e. if the MM sees your order and likes the other side, you will get filled). If you trade frequently enough and do some basic transaction cost analysis, you will find that you get picked off more  (i.e. adverse move after the order got filled with a frequency higher than a random fill would assume) and that you miss opportunities more (i.e. orders that did not get filled had a favorable move soon after).  \nIt is common for retail/semi-retail traders to shrug off the implicit transaction costs built into PFOF, but these costs are very real and do add up over time."

Buy generic brands: Store-brand items are often cheaper than name-brands and can be just as good.\n3. Use coupons and sales: Check flyers and online deals before going grocery shopping.\n4. Eat less meat: Meat is usually one of the most expensive parts of a meal. Try incorporating more plant-based proteins like beans or lentils into your diet.\n5. Cook from scratch: Prepackaged foods tend to be more expensive than cooking from raw ingredients. Learn some simple recipes and cook in bulk.\n6. Don't waste food: Plan your meals so that leftovers can become new meals later in the week.\n7. Shop smartly: Stick to the perimeter of the store where fresh produce, meats, and dairy are located. Avoid the inner aisles with prepackaged snacks and convenience foods.\n8. Bring reusable bags: Some stores offer discounts if you bring your own bags instead of using their plastic ones.\n9. Drink water: Bottled drinks add up quickly. Carry a refillable water bottle instead.\n\nAs for an actual number, it depends on factors such as location, lifestyle, and dietary restrictions.

Add groceries ($150/mo) for dinner (often sandwiches - not as cheap as cooking, by far) and cereal, add $200 for other going out to restaurants / brunch with friends outside work.  Doesn't include drinks - which are a whole 'other beast.  This is probably on the very high end of reasonable.  Yeah you CAN spend more, but you'd have to try pretty hard.  When I do my 'emergency' planning - what if I lost my job, etc. - food and drink is a place I can save $500 / mo pretty quickly.

I checked my accounts this morning, like every morning, and I noticed that the card I use for the bills was showing a $0 balance (expected since I paid it off 3 days ago), but the available credit was also showing $0. I called Capital One, and they said this was because \"the fraud department placed a hold on the last payment to ensure it clears your bank\".

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nAm stuck renting an office I cant pay for I do bodywork a few times a week & rent a small room in an office building in Colorado for this. Just in the past 6 months my business really started booming, until COVID. Now I am stuck paying over $500 a month for a room that I cant use and know that once I can go back to work I will have lost a lot of my clientele due to the financial hardships everyone is facing. My lease goes until May 2021, there is no subletting allowed, and there is no escape clause in the contract. I reached out to the landlord requesting a reduced rent or to be allowed to break my contract. They responded that I should look into a small business loan. I have a family to support and am afraid if I take out a loan I wont be able to repay it. Do I have any other options?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Unfortunately, your lease agreement seems clear: you're obligated to pay rent through May 2021, with no way to get out of it early. There are some things you could try:\n\n- Negotiate payment terms: Instead of asking for a full rent reduction, ask if they would allow you to defer payments for a few months (perhaps in exchange for a longer commitment after the crisis passes).\n- Look for government assistance: Depending on where you live, there may be grants or loans available to help businesses weather the pandemic. Check with local authorities or trade organizations.\n- Consider downsizing: If you don't need such a large space, consider finding a smaller location that you can afford. This might mean losing some clients, but it could also save you money overall.\n- Explore alternative revenue streams: Can you offer virtual consultations or online classes instead of in-person sessions? Could you partner with another business to share expenses? Get creative!",
        "answer_1": "This was just the first round of bargaining and your landlord rejected as expected. In the next few rounds you'll tell your landlord that you are unable to continue payments and they will most likely move towards you.\nTry to land a deal to suspend the lease for 3-6 months or work out a deal to pay a lump sum to break the lease. In the worst case, just suspend payments.\nOverall, just keep in mind that your landlord might have to feed a family himself and relies on that rent paid.",
        "answer_2": "Are these things spelled out in the lease agreement? For instance Colorado is now under lockdown and if this office building is deemed non essential and ordered to shut down. In this case are you still expected to pay rent even though the government isn't allowing anyone to use the building? What if the building say burns down or got taken out by a tornado or something? At some point you would be justified in not paying any rent because the room you've rented is not available for you to use."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\ncan someone please describe the experience of short selling a stock? Hi,\nSo, I just upgraded e*trade to a margin account, and I would like to short a stock when I feel like it will drop. So far I've been doing OK with the \"buy low, sell high\" process, and I've been selling and just waiting when stocks have been dropping recently. I'd like to be shorting and making money, since I'm pretty confident (and have been correct, so far) generally about when things will drop.  \nMaybe it's just me, but it seems scary to short a stock. Theoretically, it's just the opposite of buying long. But it seems like it's more of a gamble. Do you feel this way?  \nSo, what was your first short sell like? Do you have advice, or any \"rules of thumb\", like \"don't spend more than 50% of available cash to short a stock\", \"sell and take your losses if stock rises 20%\", etc.?   \nHow long do you typically hold before selling back? Are there any difficulties I may have? I know that if price goes UP, I'll lose money. But are there any situations where things can get out of hand real quick? I usually check my etrade every 15-30 mins.  \nTHANKS for any advice you may have!  \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Short selling is not the same as buying low and selling high. When you buy a stock, you hope it goes up. When you short a stock, you hope it goes down. And here's the kicker: unlimited loss potential.\nWhen you short a stock, you borrow shares from your brokerage firm at the current market price, with the expectation that you can buy them back later at a lower price to return to the lender. If the stock price goes up instead, you're on the hook for an ever-increasing amount of money until you either cover the position (buying back the shares) or the brokerage closes out the trade.\nThere are no hard and fast rules for short selling, but some general guidelines include:\n- Don't short stocks you don't understand\n- Limit the size of your short positions relative to your overall portfolio and risk tolerance\n- Have a clear reason for why you think the stock will go down, based on fundamental or technical analysis\n- Be prepared to lose money - short sales often involve leverage, which magnifies both gains and losses\n- Monitor your shorts closely, especially during volatile markets\nAs for how long to hold, that depends entirely on your strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock in question. Some traders aim to close out their shorts quickly, while others let them run for weeks or months. It really comes down to your own comfort level and risk management approach.",
        "answer_1": "Once again, I am posting this comment in response to people who want to short sell.  Don't do it.  If you really want to profit from a down fall in the price of a security, then purcahse a put option.  It is the same thing.  You are speculating on the movement.  When you purcahse a put option your risk of loss is strictly limited to the amount you paid for the option.  If the short moves against you (prices rises), the option loses value, but you will not lose more than your initial investment.  With a put option purchase, you will not be required to fill a margin call, and the only time your position is liquidated is if you fail to exercise or sell the option before expirary.",
        "answer_2": "If you short a stock that isn't readily traded, there is a possibility that your loan (brokerage lends you the securities to sell short) could get called in and you would be forced to cover the position (and miss out on future benefits of the stock dropping in price)\nYou will be paying dividends rather than receiving them if the stock you're short selling pays out to shareholders.\nI am sure this is different in a lot of places, but there are varying short margin requirements (depending on the price level of the stock) that could require you to secure your position with 200% cash. (ie. short $100 of ABC, margin requirement: $200 cash)\nYou are at risk for the theoretically unlimited upside to the stock, while your potential gain is only maximized if the stock drops to $0.\nAnd, again depending on liquidity of the stock, there might not be enough available to borrow to fill your order.\nDepending on the regulatory environment you are trading in, there may be sanctions in place to prevent you from shorting (European financials for example).\nIf you are going to short, you should definitely put in a stop buy order to protect your downside.\nAs mentioned, an easier way to capitalize on a bearish trend is to buy a put option. The advantages vs. short selling include:\nYour downside is limited to the size of the premium you pay. (out of the money puts are generally pretty cheap - great if you can see something like Sino Forest coming)\nYou can lever control on many more shares than you could by shorting.\nThere is no risk of your lender calling in your loan to demand delivery of shares.\nLess stringent margin requirements.\nYou can buy a put with an expiry that is decently far out (much longer than most investors would be comfortable holding a short position) giving you a better chance that whatever event/announcement/activity you think will negatively affect the share price has a chance to manifest."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nBuy and hold for life strategy Why would one want to invest and hold on to dividend paying stocks for life (as in never selling the stock)? I ask this because the yeilds for dividends  tend to be low, meaning that it would take many years for one to regain their principal back and actually start making a profit. \nFor instance if I bought a dividend distributing share with a yeild of 2% at the moment of purchase, assuming the dividend cash amount does not change significantly, would it not take 50 years for me to regain the money spent on the stock? I've always heard praises about the buy and hold strategy and how it played a large part in Warren Buffet's techniques, but 50 years to make a profit does not really seem like a great strategy. Is there a misunderstanding that I have?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The idea behind \"buy and hold\" is not just about holding onto the stock forever, but rather focusing on long-term growth potential over short-term price fluctuations. While the initial yield may be low, dividend-paying stocks often increase both their payouts and stock prices over time as companies grow and become more profitable. This compounding effect can lead to significant returns over decades, even if you don't see immediate profits. Additionally, reinvesting those dividends into buying more shares further accelerates your gains. It's important to remember that investing should be done with a long-term horizon in mind, and trying to time the market or sell based on short-term fluctuations can often result in missed opportunities and underperformance.",
        "answer_1": "I don't think you understand this at all.\n\"For life\" is just a euphemism.  People don't literally take their stocks to the grave.  If they do, they're generally passing it on to offspring or charities.\nAnd if you understood appreciation, you'd understand that you could sell off some of your stock as it appreciates and still have plenty left over to let it continue to appreciate.  ",
        "answer_2": "While you are technically correct that it would take 50 years to get the money back, that\u2019s assuming both the stock price and the dividend never changes. Many dividend stocks have an annual growth of the dividend alone at about 4-8%, and on top of that, more often than not the stock price will go up over time as well. \nThat said, there are plenty of dividend paying ETFs that are perfect for long holds, like the smart beta ones who focuses on high dividend stocks that are also low-volatile, as this strategy sorts out most of the garbage.\nThose ETFs can give you 4% in yearly dividends and perform better than many other index ETFs, while at the same time is safer than stock picking.

(I now have WOW Cable, thank God.)\nReceived my final bill for $77.60, which says the due date is 10/05/14. Okay! No biggie. At least they didn't cause a whole final bill fiasco, charge me for equipment that I returned, or any of the other terrifying situations that I've read about involving dealing with Comcast and closing accounts.\nI thought all was well too soon I suppose. I get a call a day or two after receiving my final bill in the mail from a collections agency telling me that my account has been turned over to them and they want me to pay my balance right away.\nPoints I try to argue: A) My bill is not due until 10/05/14.

For over four years I paid the ungodly amounts that they wanted for average speed \"HSI\" and television channels that play the same crap over and over.\nOf course none of this matters to her, because there is such a language barrier.

        "prediction": "When a large percentage of a company's outstanding shares are held by institutional investors (such as mutual funds, pension funds, and other financial organizations), it generally indicates that these entities have confidence in the company's management, business model, and future prospects. Institutional ownership can also provide the company with greater access to capital markets, as well as stability during periods of market volatility.\n\nIn your first question, when over 90% of the stock is owned by institutions, it is highly unusual for an individual investor to hold any significant stake in the company. This level of institutional ownership typically only occurs for very large, established companies like Coca-Cola or Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe second question refers to the \"float\" - this measures the number of shares available for trading in the public market, excluding insider shares. When the float is above 100%, it means that there are more shares being shorted (borrowed) than actually exist. This is known as a \"short squeeze,\" where short sellers must buy back their borrowed shares at a higher price due to the increased demand, which can lead to rapid price appreciation.

Be sure to check your loan agreement before making any decisions.\n4. Taxes: While you lose the deduction for mortgage interest, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.

However, this assumes that you can consistently earn more than the interest rate charged on the loan.\n2. Opportunity Cost - By keeping the cash, you miss out on potential investment gains. While you might earn more than the loan interest rate, you also lose out on whatever return you could have earned had you invested elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, whether you should pay cash or finance depends on your personal preference and risk tolerance.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nDoes it make sense for me to spend all of my savings on college? Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college and to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually not a very good thing?\nMy boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me before I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to <$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I recieved it in the year which would affect my aid.  \nMy feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.\n\u2022 I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.\nI'm a long time lurker here, and after seeing some similar posts recently, I felt inspired to share my situation and talk to the kind people at r/personalfinance who're more financially adept than I am. It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, and emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.\n\nGrants wouldn't save you that much, my boyfriend could be telling me to spend 80k to save >15k over the years right? I've no way of knowing how much to keep before its hurting me, or if I start spending more than I'd save in grants. What do you think the smartest way to use this money is?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Your boyfriend is correct. You should not spend this gift on anything other than education. Your mother gave you this money to help you go to college, not buy a house or a car. By using it for those purposes, you will lose out on significant amounts of financial aid, including grants and work study programs. Wait until next year to enroll in classes, and use the money only for tuition, fees, textbooks, and living expenses while you are a full-time student. Save the rest for emergencies. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and you should treat it accordingly.",
        "answer_1": "You know your boyfriend better than any of us, but this gives me an uneasy feeling. You may lose eligibility for financial aid depending on the school, but the answer to this is not to spend all the money at once. Ideally, you shouldn't have told him about the money, because now he is more likely to try and get it out of you. But the cat is out of the bag. As much as possible, save that money and pretend it's not there (i.e., keep working and saving as you were before). \nIn order to prevent spending all of the money on school, would you be open to considering doing 2 years at a community college? My partner went this route and probably saved about $20k.",
        "answer_2": "I think your boyfriend may have a point, by receiving that money now you may have lost eligibility to financial aid for this year. I think the suggestion to spend some of it to get your eligibility back has some merit, but don't spend it on him and don't spend on anything that you wouldn't have spent originally. That's why he said to prepay your mum's rent.\nI dont know what you can do now, but it may be good to keep looking into how you can get your eligibility for financial aid back starting next year."

Anyone else confused by this?\nCrosspost from r/personalfinance\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "No, you're not understanding it correctly. When they say \"Vanguard is owned by the funds managed by the company\", they don't literally mean that the funds themselves hold shares in Vanguard. Instead, they're using a legal structure called a mutual holding company (MHC). In short, Vanguard set up a separate entity to manage its funds, and that entity owns Vanguard itself. This allows profits generated by managing the funds to flow back to the funds instead of being paid out as dividends or bonuses to shareholders. It also means that Vanguard cannot be acquired by another company without the consent of the MHC, since it would effectively be acquiring itself. The key point here is that your money isn't going towards enriching Vanguard executives - it's staying within the ecosystem of Vanguard funds.",
        "answer_1": "As you mentioned owners of Vanguard the company are shareholders of Vanguard funds. With most brokers, they are a publicly traded company owned by shareholders who might use the company as broker or those who don\u2019t with the only relationship with the company being via ownership of the company\u2019s shares. \nFor example, let\u2019s use Charles Schwab. They are publicly traded and have shareholders who each own a percentage of the company like any other publicly traded company. Schwab may offer funds with names like Schwab International or Schwab Tech that are products they offer. You can own any of these funds but that doesn\u2019t equal ownership in Charles Schwab the company, only their funds. Unless you actually own shares of Charles Schwab the company, you\u2019re just treating the company as a company you do business with. For example, I can use Vanguard for everything in my portfolio but also own shares of Charles Schwab the company in my Vanguard portfolio. Thus, I own both companies. If I use Schwab for my whole portfolio but don\u2019t actually hold any shares of Schwab the company then I only own whatever is in my portfolio and nothing for Charles Schwab the company.\nThe advantages of Vanguard being own by their funds/shareholders of these funds is that they don\u2019t have to focus as much on returning money back shareholders like a publicly traded company does. There is no dividend payout or pressure to grow to please shareholders. Instead their funds and the companies within those funds will take care of all that for them. Because they don\u2019t have these responsibilities, they can pass down the cost savings of no dividend payouts or having to spend money to grow to users of the Vanguard platform via low fees/expenses. If Vanguard was publicly traded like Charles Schwab then they\u2019d have to take care of costs of running the company first, then the costs of rewarding the shareholders next before doing anything for the users (not the shareholders of Schwab) of their services last.\nIt\u2019s definitely confusing and complicated and I\u2019m not even sure how big of a difference it makes realistically today but that\u2019s the best I can explain it.",

Our parents are extremely helpful (paid for my undergrad and helping out still). \nI'm slowly making my way through many of the resources in the FAQ and reading some of the suggested books, but I'm still an extreme novice when it comes to personal finance, so please forgive my ignorance on anything.\nAs a Muslim, I personally am against GAINING from interest with no/little risk. That means I don't want to put my money in a savings account, CD, bonds, etc. I am, however, not opposed to paying interest (e.g. mortgage, other loans, etc). I understand that in this day in age in America it's hard to get by without paying interest on anything. \nSo my question, finally: where can I put my money to better my personal situation?

I'm young, confused, and English is my 3rd language. \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Firstly, let me clarify something - there's nothing wrong with having beliefs or values about how you earn your money. However, you need to realize that being against gaining interest doesn't mean you won't have any expenses. You'll still pay interest on things like student loans, car payments, credit cards, mortgages, etc. The goal isn't to avoid all forms of interest, it's to manage them wisely.\nThat said, here's what I would recommend based on your circumstances:\n- Create an emergency fund: This should be your first priority. Put aside at least three months worth of living expenses into a high yield savings account. Don't worry about interest rates here; you're saving up for emergencies, not trying to make money off of it.\n- Pay down debt: If you have any high interest debts (like credit card balances), focus on paying those off as quickly as possible. Interest rates matter more than principle here.\n- Live within your means: Graduate students often struggle with overspending because they see their peers doing the same thing. Resist the urge to keep up with others and stick to a budget.\n- Invest for retirement: Yes, even if you're against earning interest, you still need to save for retirement. Look into Roth IRAs or 401(k) plans offered by your university. Again, don't worry too much about returns right now; focus on contributing consistently over time.\nRemember, knowledge is power! Keep learning and asking questions. Good luck!",

You are obtaining benefit on a change of price when value is created by owning a piece that company.\nSplitting the line the way I described it... Items that change price are stocks, commodities, and currencies. Items that involve interest on loans are deposit accounts, CDs, and bonds.\nI apologize, again, if this does not match the definition for your religion. I am not terribly familiar with the sin of usury in other cultures.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\n'DIY or die' ethos Soon after I started pursuing FI/ER five years ago, I started to develop what I call a 'DIY or die' philosophy on how I make decisions. What that means to me is that instead of buying things that I might need, I look for ways to make these items myself. At first this was just to save money to invest toward my FI/ER strategy. I started cooking all my own food, growing a lot of my own vegetables (outdoors and indoors), building computers, bikes, extensions to the house. Over time I realized that making my own stuff has given me a true sense of pride. I started to wonder if this DIY, feel good cycle is something most people in Western culture are missing in their lives. I think now that consumerism/capitalism has encroached too far into our personal lives. Any of you have thoughts on this? I would love to hear them.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, there's definitely a trend towards \"consumerism\" where we buy products without thinking about it, rather than creating or fixing things ourselves. This can lead to several negative consequences:\n\n1. Financial cost: Buying pre-made goods often comes with a premium price tag due to branding, marketing, packaging, and distribution costs. By making your own, you cut out those expenses and potentially save a significant amount of money.\n2. Environmental impact: Many mass-produced goods come with excessive waste from packaging, transportation, and disposal. Making your own reduces the environmental footprint by eliminating some of these factors.\n3. Sense of accomplishment: There's nothing quite like completing a project yourself and feeling proud of the result. It gives us a sense of self-reliance and confidence.\n4. Learning opportunities: When you create something yourself, you learn new skills along the way. Whether it's cooking, gardening, carpentry, or computer programming, each new skill opens up more possibilities for future projects.\n5. Cost savings over time: While the initial investment may be higher when making something yourself, the long-term cost savings can add up significantly. For example, learning to cook your own meals instead of eating out saves money on restaurant bills, while repairing broken items instead of replacing them saves money on replacement costs.\n\nOverall, embracing a DIY mindset can lead to financial benefits, environmental benefits, personal growth, and a greater sense of satisfaction.",

Are they right - am I being too frugal / unrealistic? Recent college grad here who's starting a new job next week.  I'm subletting an apartment for the summer from a friend (got a great deal for an amazing place), but now I'm looking for an apartment to lease starting in August.  I work outside Atlanta in a city called Alpharetta, so there are a ton of options in the area, both in terms of price and in terms of location.\nI've been fortunate in that my parents have covered my rent while I'm in college, but this has now left me in a position where I'm a little unsure of what I should be paying for rent.  My plan was to live frugally over the next few years so that I could quickly pay off a $26,000 loan I owe my parents for my last year of college.  I made this plan with the understanding that it would likely necessitate a drop in living standard from what I've had while my parents were supporting me.\nI was aiming to spend about $600 a month on rent + $100 a month on utilities.  Here is my full budget (I made what I thought were conservative estimates, so some of the categories may be a little high):\nIncome\n\n$2300 (monthly after-tax)\n\nExpenses\n\n$600 Rent\n$100 Utilities\n$200 Groceries\n$50 Restaurants\n$200 Auto Insurance\n$20 Highway Toll\n$200 Gas\n$215 Loan Payment\n$50 Entertainment\n$30 Haircut\n$25 Miscellaneous\n$8 Hulu Plus\n\nLeft Over\n\n$602\n\nBasically my plan was to take that extra $602 a month an throw it at my loan so that I could be done with it as soon as possible.  I talked to my parents today though, and they said that I shouldn't constrict myself too much - that if I was able to find a better apartment in a better location I should consider spending an extra hundred or two a month; that I shouldn't kill myself to be too frugal.  Keep in mind that my parents are the epitome of frugal - they have literally no debt, pay cash for their cars, coupon, etc.\nNow I will admit that there is a big difference between a $600 a month apartment in Atlanta and an $800 a month apartment.  For $800 I could live in a gated community with a pool and tennis courts in a good location like the Virginia Highlands or Buckhead.  For $600 a month I'm going to have to look for something less fancy, in a less desirable and potentially less safe location.\nI was willing to make a little bit of a sacrifice in terms of my living accommodations in order to get my financial house in order, but now my parents have thrown me for a loop.

I asked my realtor if we could add a time is of the essence clause, up the deposit and add a bonus to the agent who brought A buyer.  She said no to all three. I had originally stuck with this agent because my fianc\u00e9 insisted on using her. He\u2019s pretty mad that I\u2019ve cut ties with her and that\u2019s a new dynamic that I don\u2019t quite understand.\nI got a final offer on my house that was really low, so low that I was only going to break even on it.  I accepted and the buyers backed out 5 days later and the reason they gave was that they couldn\u2019t afford the payment. Because buyers in California have 17 days to back out I don\u2019t receive any earnest money.  I\u2019ve taken my house off the market and severed ties with my agent.\nIt\u2019s been almost three months since I\u2019ve put my house on the market. A house similar size as mine but without an updated kitchen (it has a white porcelain counter and I have granite) was just listed 40k higher than mine and after talking to the buyer they\u2019ve received a nearly full price offer. I\u2019m thinking my house probably looks like something is wrong with it due to it being on the market so long.   I guess I\u2019ll hold on to it for another year or so and try again. \nThanks for reading this novel and for all the advice :)\nOriginal post:\nSo as stated, I can\u2019t sell my house.  The house was built in 2011. I bought it dec 2014 for 255k.  I am in the Central Valley of California.  My house is part of a planned community that was half built when I bought my house.  The houses built after I bought my house are roughly 1000 square foot larger and cost about 100k more.  The house has granite, wood floors, new carpet (2017) and has been painted with a fresh coat of paint.  It is in a gated complex with access to a pool, water park and playground.\nI am getting married in 26 days and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they\u2019ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.\nThis past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I\u2019m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.\nWe are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it\u2019s not a great option with this house.\nDoes anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?\nThank you so much for reading this!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, you need a new realtor. Your current one seems to be doing everything wrong. Here's why:\n- Telling you \"no\" to adding a time is of the essence clause, which is standard practice in many areas.\n- Not advising you to take legal action against the multiple buyers who backed out.\n- Accepting an offer below your asking price, then lowering it further when the next buyer backs out.\nYou should interview other agents and find someone who will actually help you sell your home.",
        "answer_1": "This was probably mentioned in response to your original post, but buyers should not be surprised by the size of their payments/interest rates. They should be submitting a pre-approval letter for their loan along with their offer. In getting that letter they should be made aware of an estimated monthly payment. ",
        "answer_2": "Maybe your listing agent didn't do a good job. How was the open house? Did the photos look good? I know you had many offers, but presentation makes a lasting impact on buyers - speaking from experience as a buyer myself. Maybe when you try again, hire the agent who listed that other house."

If you're a homeowner, you can calculate your mortgage:income ratio (sometimes called a front-end ratio) by dividing your monthly mortgage costs (usually including associated costs like homeowner's insurance, property tax and mortgage insurance) by your pretax monthly salary.\nFor example, if you earn $10,000 per month ($120,000 per year salary) and you pay $2,000 per month in mortgage costs and related fees, your mortgage:income ratio is 0.20.\n0.20 = 2,000 / 10,000\n\nLenders recommend that this number not go above 0.28, but we at Personal Finance know that this number should be as low as you can make it while meeting your housing requirements. So I'd love to hear from folks who own their homes:\n\nWhat is your mortgage:income ratio? What was it when you bought your house?\nWhat area do you live in? (or: do you live in a low or high cost-of-living area?)\nDoes your mortgage feel too high? Conversely, do you ever wish you took on a larger mortgage for a more expensive house?\nAny general advice about finding the right ratio?\n\nLooking forward to some good conversation!\n<|assistant|>\n",

We bought our first home last summer and are very happy with our decision.\nWe live in a small town in the Midwest where houses are relatively affordable. We both grew up here and didn't want to deal with the hassle of renting anymore.\nOur mortgage feels incredibly manageable, especially since we saved aggressively before buying and have an emergency fund. The only time we worry about money is when one of us loses our job, because then we would still need to cover all those expenses without any income coming in. But overall, we're really glad we bought instead of continuing to throw away thousands of dollars every year in rent.\nAdvice: Save as much as possible before buying. Don't let anyone talk you into buying a more expensive house than you can comfortably afford. It's better to wait a few years and buy something you truly love than to rush into a purchase and regret it later.

I'm a long-time lurker on my main account, and I didn't want to disclose tax info that could be linked to me. Alright, with that out of the way, :rubs hands together: here we go. \nMy husband worked for a big corporation in for a couple of years. His employment ended in 2012 when we moved to a different city. He had stock in the company as part of his benefits, but did nothing with them, so far as I know, when he left. I don't think he even consciously knew they were there, though he did tell me at one point about them; I just didn't think to ask about them when he left.  \nYesterday, I got a letter from the IRS. This letter claimed that my husband and I had earned income that we hadn't claimed in 2014. From what I can tell from the itemized list, this is money is from the stocks that he had while at that company, for a total of about $8,000. Here's the thing: we haven't seen this money, and now we owe Uncle Sam about $2,000.\nWe have the $2K (THANK YOU EMERGENCY FUND), but here's what I'm wondering:\n\n\nWhere the heck did the money go, and how do we go about finding it?\n\n\nWhy were the stocks cashed out to begin with? From what I can tell, the company wasn't bought (it was CGI Group).\n\n\nCould someone have gotten his identity and sold them, then taken the money? Or even cashed a check that we might have gotten at our old address? If so, how do we go about fraud claims (or whatever it is we need to do).\n\n\nCan we defer paying the IRS till this all gets sorted out \u2014 without having to pay the interest? Or would you suggest paying it off now and then trying to find the money?\n\n\nIn general, I'm wondering what our next steps are. Our tax bill is due on June 8, and I'm not worried about that, but it sure would be nice to have that money if we can get it\u2014especially so we don't have to pay taxes on money we didn't get. \nAny thoughts on this?

It sounds like your husband failed to do this originally, leading to the current issue. As for whether you can defer payment, see Publication 594, \"The IRS Collection Process\".

Ask about financing options: Some window companies offer financing with low interest rates, making it easier to spread out the cost over time.\n\n6.

Cyclical nature of demand: Demand for PC processors, which are AMD's primary product, tends to fluctuate based on economic conditions. During recessions, consumers tend to delay purchases of new computers, leading to lower sales for AMD. This unpredictability adds an extra layer of risk for investors.\n\n3. High R&D costs: Developing new technology requires significant investment in research and development (R&D). AMD has been investing heavily in R&D to catch up to Intel, but these expenses can put pressure on earnings and cause uncertainty among investors.\n\n4. Market perception: Despite its successes, some investors still view AMD as a smaller, less established company compared to Intel. This perception can make them more sensitive to negative news or setbacks, even if they don't have a major impact on AMD's long-term prospects.\n\n5. Short sellers: There is a large short position in AMD's stock, meaning many investors are betting against the company. These shorts can amplify price swings, making the stock more volatile than it would otherwise be.\n\nAs for what needs to happen for AMD to become more stable, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. Consistent execution: If AMD can consistently deliver strong financial results and execute on its strategy, it may help to ease investor concerns about its future.\n\n2. Diversification: While processors remain AMD's core business, expanding into other areas like graphics cards or server chips could provide additional sources of revenue and reduce reliance on the cyclical PC market.\n\n3. Reduced competition: If AMD can gain a larger market share from Intel, it may help to stabilize the stock by reducing the perceived risk of losing out to a stronger rival.\n\n4. Improved profit margins: While AMD has made progress in narrowing the gap between itself and Intel, it still lags behind when it comes to profit margins. Closing that gap could help to alleviate concerns about the company's financial health.",
        "answer_1": "part of the tech sector - very volatile\nAMD is not profitable yet, huge chunk of it's valuation is being priced on hype/potential. so we'll see a lot of huge swings until they actually deliver whether they can meet investor demands or fall short",
        "answer_2": "Ask the consumers. Call 15 computer shops/custom build guys and ask them who they prefer. Business management aside, you're going to find AMD loyalty at each of the shops.\nI would say hold it. Stop trying to get rich quick, only a lack of morals succeeds in doing so at the cost of others."

Hi all,\nOver the last year my father has gotten sick, put on permanent SS disability , and with no other income or savings besides that. My mother does not work. I live with my parents and my younger brother who is still in college. He is 23. We also live in NJ is that makes a difference \nNow for the details:\nMy fathers SS pays \\~ $2000 monthly which does not even cover the house mortgage. Thats all the income my parents have. They used to file taxes jointly.\nI cover everything else including all the food, house hold bills, their credit card debt, car insurance, etc. Now this year I began working an entry level  engineering position in Pharma making \\~ 60k. Its a contract position so I don't get insurance ,PTO, or any of the nice perks.\nWhats the best way to handle our income taxes? Can I claim my parents?

        "prediction": "No, you cannot claim them as dependents. Your father passed the gross income test (over $4,150), but he did not pass the \"support test\" because you are already providing more than half of his support. This means your parents must file a joint tax return reporting only their Social Security benefits. You should not claim any dependency exemptions or credits for your parents when you file your own tax return.",
        "answer_1": "I would look into filing as head of household, rather than single, with your parents and sibling as qualified dependents. It allows for a high standard deduction and lower tax rate.\nTo qualify as dependents, there is a certain earned income level threshold that they cannot reach, but I do not believe SS counts against that threshold.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nConfused about ETFs I started looking more into ETFs and I'm finding that the performance is just horrible for some of them. That's why I figure I'm doing something wrong in terms of interpreting it. Taking a look at [VEU](  for example, I see the value was higher in 2007 than it is even now. There's no reason to thrown money in there, when there hasn't been an increase over a 10 year period, but is this actually the case? Do ETFs pay dividends as well or something else that can give you gains? Thanks!\n<|assistant|>\n",

The price of an ETF will fluctuate based on the performance of the companies within its underlying index.\n\nIn your case, the MSCI Europe Index has not performed particularly well since the financial crisis in 2008. This does not mean that ETFs do not work - it means that the market they are tracking has not done well. If you invest in an ETF like VEU today, you would be buying into all the European stocks represented by that index, with the expectation that their prices will go up over time. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, so there are no guarantees.\n\nAs for dividends, many ETFs do pay dividends, depending on what type of securities they hold. For VEU specifically, yes, it pays out regular dividends.",

I initially put in ~$430 to my Robinhood account, which I\u2019ve grown to ~$500 based on what I\u2019ve learned through reading articles/books and watching a lot of YouTube. Since I\u2019ve begun, I\u2019ve only invested in \u201cbig name\u201d stocks (CGC, AAPL, TSLA, etc). \nEverywhere I look, I always see how the S&P 500 has succeeded immensely in the last 20 years, with most traders being unable to beat it. A lot of people continue to say that the S&P is the safest bet with regards to long term investing. I have about 3k saved up and was considering putting 1.5-2k in ETFs like SPY or VOO while keeping the $500 I already have in Robinhood to play around with other actual stocks. I guess this leads me to my questions:\nWould it be smart to throw such a large portion of my money into S&P 500 ETFs?\nWhy is there so much hype surrounding it?\nAre there any bear cases for it?\nI realize I can find a lot of this info online, but I want to see a lot of individual takes on this since I\u2019m just getting into the game. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The S&P 500 is considered by many as the \"safe\" bet because it's an index fund containing the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US. It's diversified across multiple sectors, industries, and company sizes. This means you don't need to pick winners or losers - instead, you get exposure to the entire economy.\n\nThere are no guarantees when it comes to investing, but historically speaking, the S&P 500 has returned roughly 10% annually over very long time horizons. Individual stocks can outperform or underperform, but trying to predict those outcomes is incredibly difficult.\n\nBy throwing a significant portion of your money into an S&P 500 ETF, you're reducing risk and increasing your chances of meeting your long-term financial goals. You should still keep some money aside for more speculative investments if you wish, but treating the majority of your portfolio as a passive investment is generally recommended.",
        "answer_1": "Because if you buy stocks on your own, the high liklihood is that you may do well initially, but eventually you'll get in something that doesn't do well and you'll not want to sell because then you'd be \"losing money\".  Over time, this causes your returns to be much lower, and more stressful, than simply putting the money into an S&P 500 fund and forgetting about it.",
        "answer_2": "This year's winners are next years losers and last year's losers are this year's winners. Unless you are doing deep qualitative value analysis on your investments you really don't want to just guess. An index gives you a stake in everything at once, which is far safer over time."

        "prediction": "Yes, here are a few things to consider:\n1. Sustainability of the dividend: Make sure that the company has a track record of paying and increasing its dividend over time. This indicates that management is committed to returning value to shareholders and that the business is financially stable enough to continue doing so.\n2. Business fundamentals: Look at the underlying health of the company's operations. Are they profitable? Do they have a competitive advantage in their industry? Are they generating cash flow? These factors will help ensure that the company can afford to pay out dividends even during tough times.\n3. Valuation: Don't just focus on the yield; make sure you're not sacrificing too much in terms of price. High-yielding stocks may be attractive because investors perceive them as riskier or less desirable than other options, which could lead to an inflated dividend yield but also a lower overall return if the stock price falls significantly.\n4. Risk tolerance: Remember that higher yields often come with higher risks. Be prepared to accept volatility and potential losses in exchange for the extra income.\n5. Tax implications: Some types of dividends (such as qualified dividends) are taxed differently from regular income, while others (such as returns of capital) aren't truly sustainable sources of income. Understand how your dividends will be treated by the taxman before making any decisions.",
        "answer_1": "Look at earnings.  If dividends are too high and earnings too low, you gotta figure that the company is enticing you to buy the stock based on dividend yield and to ignore the fundamentals of the company.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nMy wife will receive a generous defined-benefits pension. How should this affect our savings habits? To hell with our IRAs? My wife is an assistant principal of public high school in Brooklyn and makes about $100k. At 31, she's been with the Dept. of Ed. for 9 years, and if she retires at about 60 (38 years service time), she'll have a little more then 70% of her salary paid out to her until she dies. Let me say outright how bloody fortunate we are. Well aware, and humbled.\nI make in the neighborhood of $30k as your friendly neighborhood security guard, and together we have about $7k a month in take-home pay (after 10% goes to our retirement plans), of which about $4k is gobbled by fixed and semi-fixed expenses, notably a $2200 mortgage with $620/mo maintenance fee (it's Brooklyn.) That leaves $3k. (We also have a 1 year old child.)\nEverything I've read on this lovely, lovely sub stresses heavy retirement savings, which has been enlightening. But it seems like we'll be well set for retirement, especially when our mortgage is paid off when we're both 61 (hopefully.) So I'm kind of not sure what to do with my savings.\nWe have the kid, so I wonder if I should forego IRA contributions and instead plow the money into a 529? Other things I've thought of doing are paying off our modest car loan and our modest student loans, or maybe even throwing money at our mortgage to pay down the principal (4.5% interest)? Then I've also thought: \"You're being dumb, you should still put in an IRA. Maybe a Roth IRA so you can pull from it.\"\nThen there's investing. I'm a rank amateur in this field and will do more research. But I'd be interested in building up -- maybe in lieu of those IRAs -- a semi-liquid \"Big Ticket Fund,\" to spend on things like vacations, home renovations, kids' camps and travel teams, etc. I'd like this to be accessible, obviously, but it seems like I could build it big enough that part of the money could be out there doing work. Index funds? Or maybe this should be the Roth IRA?\nA few last things. 1. I definitely realize nothing is a sure thing, though I would be very surprised if my wife lost her job. She's tenured, and very good at it. I guess it would be more likely she'd decide on other employment, but this seems very unlikely too. And I'd be thunderstruck if we ever divorced. We're extremely solid 7 years in. 2. I am not sure, on the other hand, if her pension could be legally pared down in the future. I would of course be interested in information here. 3. I plan on insuring both our lives but haven't gotten there quick yet. All of this is a process -- thanks PF! 4. I believe in generally living modestly instead of precise budgeting, so though I understand where you're coming from if you think it's folly, I don't want my \"big ticket fund\" weighted toward particular goals. I have a small kid, might have another, and truly don't know what to expect out of life.\nMany thanks for your help, peeps. Lurking on PF has been a real education but it seems like my situation might be a little different. \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Just because your wife has a great pension doesn't mean you shouldn't save for retirement yourself. You never know what the future holds - divorce, death, changes in laws regarding pensions... The goal isn't to replace your wife's income, just to ensure you have enough for your own needs.\nMax out your traditional 401(k) first, since that gets you an immediate tax break. After that, max out a Roth IRA for each of you (spousal IRA if necessary). If you still have extra cash left over after that, consider contributing to a 529 for your child's college education.\nPaying off debt early is always a smart move, but prioritize higher interest rate debts before the low interest mortgage.\nInvestment advice: index funds, either through a brokerage account or a target date retirement fund.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nWhen would I buy a mutual fund vs. the equivalent ETF? Is one almost always better than the other? I'm looking to start investing and am confused on if I should be doing ETFs or just open an account with a mutual fund.  Guidance would be appreciated!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Both mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles that allow you to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or both. Here are some factors to consider when deciding between them:\n\n1. Costs: In general, ETFs tend to have lower fees (expense ratios) than mutual funds because they don't require active management like mutual funds do. However, there are exceptions, so it's important to compare costs carefully.\n\n2. Liquidity: ETFs trade throughout the day at market prices, while mutual funds price once per day after the markets close. This means that ETFs offer greater liquidity and flexibility for buying and selling shares.\n\n3. Tax efficiency: Mutual funds can create capital gains distributions, which may result in taxable events for shareholders. Some ETFs also distribute capital gains, but many are designed to minimize these taxes through strategies such as \"in kind\" distributions.\n\n4. Rebalancing: With an ETF, you're responsible for rebalancing your portfolio yourself. With a mutual fund, this is often done automatically by the fund manager.\n\n5. Convenience: If you prefer working with a financial advisor or want access to more specialized investment options, then a mutual fund might be a better choice. Otherwise, an ETF may provide more convenience and control over your investments.\n\nUltimately, the decision between a mutual fund and an ETF will depend on your personal preferences and investment goals. It's generally recommended to start with low-cost index funds or ETFs, regardless of whether they come in mutual fund or ETF form.",
        "answer_1": "One disadvantage of ETFs is that you can only buy whole shares. If you have $1000 to invest and you're buying shares that cost $101 you'll buy 9 shares and have $91 left over. A mutual fund with the same share price would allow you to buy 9.901 shares.\nETFs generally have a lower expense ratio and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at a variable price whereas traditional mutual funds have a single updated price at the end of every day (NAV = net asset value).\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages so it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish and which financial institution you're working with.",
        "answer_2": "You've gotten good advice here.  I'll just add that it may also depend on how much you have to invest and when.  \nIf you can invest $500/month minimum, then ETFs are probably fine.  You can generally buy a number of shares that is roughly equivalent to that amount.  Obviously, the more you invest monthly the easier it is to get close to an exact amount, but it will always be off by a little.  For a long time, I did a combo of VTI, VXUS and BND that I could get to pretty close to $1000/month when that was my investment budget.\nOn the other hand, if you just want to do a set amount each month without worrying about it, you can do the mutual funds with fixed amounts very easily."

I am 23, no debt, and am only putting money into my 401k since for 18k, my employer will match 50%. I have enough savings, and if this bonus was not going to my 401k, it would go to my Vanguard S&P funds (VFIAX) instead.\nTo me, it seems like my Vanguard retirement funds grow faster than my mutual funds with them - so with less tax, if I want maxed assets by end of 2018, I would max out my retirement early, but it's not liquid.\nI am currently living in the SF Bay Area, and in 2018 making (120k salary + 45k stock + 20k bonus). I am hoping to save up to buy a house sometime soon, preferably this year. I have 110k in savings/mutual funds right now, and am living with parents, so my spending is <$500 a month.\nI am thinking it would be better for me to not put it all into my 401k, as I am most likely not looking at that money any time soon.

I'm not sure how bad that is.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "You should talk to a financial advisor about your situation because you seem confused about some basic concepts here:\n\n1. Your year-end bonus is still part of your income for 2018, regardless of when you receive it. Maxing out your 401(k) now ensures that you don't accidentally exceed the annual limit ($18,500), which could result in penalties.\n\n2. You shouldn't prioritize maximizing your retirement accounts over buying a house. If you need the money from your bonus to make a down payment on a house, then use it for that purpose. Don't sacrifice a major life goal just to eke out an extra few percentage points of return in your retirement account.\n\n3. \"My Vanguard retirement funds grow faster than my mutual funds\" doesn't really make sense. Both are invested in index funds; they should perform similarly over long periods of time. The difference may be due to fees or asset allocation, neither of which you provided details about.\n\n4. Living with your parents and having $110K in savings suggests that you might benefit from working with a professional who can help you create a comprehensive financial plan rather than trying to optimize individual decisions in isolation.",

(Details inside) We are considering buying a house and looking for advice if it makes financial sense. I work for a government agency and currently putting in for location transfer when they solicit every 6 months. Now the likelihood of my transfer getting approved probably won't happen for the next 2-5 years, but I continue to request the transfer to help my chances down the road when its actually realistic. \nThe housing market in my area is doing well and the prices are really good for brand new builds. We would most likely purchase a brand new build with the intention of renting it out when if/when we move. I'm in a military/government city which makes the chances of renting it out down the road pretty good. My desired transfer location would be in the same state which makes managing a rental a little easier. \nAlso when my agency approves a move they give you a lump sum of money depending on if you rent or own to help in the moving costs. If I rent a home I would receive around $25,000, if I own my own home I would receive $48,000. This is all before taxes by the way so the actual amount is a bit lower.

It could take longer than five years, or it might never happen at all.\n\n2. Being a landlord can be expensive and time consuming. Are you prepared to deal with tenants, maintenance issues, finding reliable renters, etc?\n\n3. There's a lot more risk involved in being a landlord than just receiving a lump sum from your employer. What happens if the tenant doesn't pay rent, or causes damage to the property? Do you have enough savings set aside to cover unexpected expenses?\n\n4. Buying a house is a big commitment, both financially and emotionally. Are you ready to potentially live somewhere else for two to five years, only to sell the house and start over again?\n\nI would recommend waiting until you actually move before becoming a landlord. In the meantime, keep saving for a down payment on your future home.",
        "answer_1": "As a rule of thumb, your monthly rent should be about 1% of your purchase price in order to cover all of your expenses and make decent cash flow.  So like if you buy a house for $300k you should be able to rent it out for $3000/mo.\nHowever I think that you will find that in areas with a strong housing market you'll get something like 50-60% of that, i.e. $1500-1700/mo.  If you run the numbers and include all costs, property tax, insurance, vacancy, marketing expenses, repair and upkeep, you'll probably be basically breaking even on a cash flow basis.  So the only way you will make money is through appreciation and paying down your mortgage.  You will make a little bit this way but if you consider your down payment tied up in the house it might not be a very good return on investment.  It would all depend on the appreciation.\nManaging a rental property when you don't live in the area is difficult because you can't go see the property and have to depend 100% on people that you hire to go out there.  If you hire a company to take care of everything, expect to pay about 8-10% of the rent to them as a fee.  This further cuts into your cash flows and if the company doesn't do a great job it can lead to additional expenses.\nOverall I'd take a very realistic look at the numbers and make sure it is worthwhile.  I would be surprised if it is. Source: I've been a landlord for 25 years.",

Don't do it.\n2) spending money on experiences or things that matter to you - this could be travel, concerts, nice dinners, etc. People who become financially independent often realize they should have done more of this earlier in life because these memories last longer than material possessions.\nthe key is to differentiate between true wants vs needs, and prioritize your spending accordingly.",

All the good stuff you listed shouldn't be traded, unless you see it's about to break down in a way you can't prevent.\nPick up a side hustle.  It's so common to fill our lives with the \"work schedule\" that allots no time to your personal growth, except for maybe on the weekends, which isn't enough to get drilled into something.  \"Personal growth\" being the key phrase here, find something that's in the neighborhood of something you already enjoy, that you want to get better at.  Example: tool-making, wood carving, jewelry-making.  Reserve enough time outside of work hours to make a little progress every day.  Aim to start a business selling your widgets, and gain profits from your passion.   If it starts to pick up, you may negotiate taking Tuesdays off or something to allow you more freedom in growing this pursuit.  \nAnother thing to consider is purchasing a percentage of the business.  If you have good enough savings or credit to invest in the company, such as to have a reasonable percentage of ownership, then you are effectively a partner.  As part owner, you should be able to bring up a vote to increase your own salary by a percentage at the next shareholder meeting.  If you buy a controlling stake, no votes are necessary.  \nI know two insurance salesmen.  One was working at the local Tea store for extra cash, then within a few years, bought the franchise location and only pokes his head in every two weeks or so.  The other has a huge grill and makes plastic-wrapped barbecue plates by the dozens and sells them to local businesses.  I think he even spends his lunch-break delivering them to offices around town.  \nIt's totally feasible to get a dirt cheap website set up showcasing some of your.... personalized hammers or what-have-you, and make web-sales, shipping on the weekends, of things that you made in your productive hobby-time.

Grandmother (85) and Grandfather (86) have lived together with my Mother for the past 5+ years. Grandmother and Grandfather own their own home and are listed together on the deed. Grandmother + Grandfather have income from Social Security + pension totaling around $6,000 per month. We aren't certain about bank balance, investments, and other liquid assets.\n&x200B\nGrandmother has developed Alzheimer's/dementia. Disease has progressively grown worse to the point of being unmanagable. Situation is causing tremendous hardship/stress. The family has hired a care worker to visit on weekdays and attend to Grandmother's needs, but even so it's increasingly untenable. There are safety issues with Grandmother being unattended, and there is a constant paranoia that she might wander out of the home in the middle of the night. She basically requires constant supervision and that isn't something we're equipped to provide. We need to get her into a nursing home.\n&x200B\nCheapest nearby nursing home is $5,000 per month. Some as high as $8,000. My understanding is Medicare won't pay, Medicaid would but they would need to declare bankruptcy to qualify.\n&x200B\nQuestion is, what is the best way to get Grandmother into a nursing home with minimum out-of-pocket whilst also protecting the house from being taken away from them? Are there state/federal programs we should be aware of? What are our options?\n&x200B\nThanks.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Medicare does not cover long term care like a nursing home. You may want to look at Medicaid planning or consult an elder law attorney. Your grandparents can gift up to $14,000 per year without penalty to help pay for the nursing home costs while still keeping the house. However, this will depend on how much money they have left after paying for the nursing home. They could also consider selling the house and splitting the proceeds between them to preserve some funds for future medical expenses. Again, I recommend consulting an elder law attorney who can give you specific guidance based on your grandparent\u2019s unique circumstances.",
        "answer_1": "I am a home health social worker. \nFor starters, get Grandma & Grandpa both on Medicaid. Different states have different rules about Medicaid. If they have any savings accounts, they will need to spend that money. Do NOT let them write you (or anyone else) a big check for thousands of dollars as a way of getting rid of it, it can mess up the Medicaid process and complicate it. \nIf the house is paid for, they might consider a reverse mortgage which means that the bank buys their house and makes payments to them for several years. This can also complicate the Medicaid process, so just be careful and try to get with an attorney who knows all the ins and outs of your state's Medicaid rules. \nSome nursing homes will take Grandma now if they know for sure that she will be approved for Medicaid. You'd have to call around and ask; usually there's at least one in each town that does that. \nSpeaking of nursing homes, the kind that you really want to put Grandma in is one with a memory care unit. This is a locked-door facility. Staff and visitors can come and go, but the patients stay and are entertained and fed and cared for all in the same place; they aren't allowed to wander. \nAlso, when picking a nursing home, show up unannounced for a visit. Don't call and ask them what their hours are or visiting policy or tip them off in any way that you are coming. Just show up. You don't want them to have time to make the place look nice just for your visit. \nAnd finally, these may be harder to find, but there are nursing homes in the community that look like regular everyday homes. They may not even have a sign out front. These places can be hit or miss. Some are fantastic and some I wouldn't send my worst enemy to, but by and large, their prices are actually pretty reasonable, usually in the $2-3K range. They may be listed in the phone book, or you can sometimes ask around, sometimes nurses know about them by word of mouth.",
        "answer_2": "There are a lot of provisions set forth for Medicaid to not take assets away from a community living based spouse.  Talk to an adult case worker or area agency on aging represenative.  They can help with assessing your grandmother to get her admitted to a facility and discuss the financial costs of doing so.\nIf your grandparents have savings/cincome wise and in general everything is split down the middle and everything on the side of grandma will go to pay for her cost of care.  Medicaid has a 5 year look back at all financial transactions and a case worker would be looking at bank statements, retirement accounts, stocks, etc.  Any asset.   Primary residences are normally excluded from asset checks as long as a spouse is using it as a primary residence.  Some income is also excluded from her side, for the spouse to live off of.  If there are a lot of complex accounts that your grandparents have it might be good to utilize an elder law attorney to do an application that will protect as much as possible for your grandfather's benefit.  If there is little to no savings less, then just go talk to a nursing home and work with them to put in an application with the state.  Most facilities i've worked at will help you organize the application and submit it themselves, so they actually get paid.   After everything is calculated, granddad will just pay whatever amounts decided upon out of savings and then eventually just a part of the monthly income (and then the facility bills the rest to the state for reimbursement).  Applications can take a while to approve for the state, but as long as everyone is helping with the process most facilities have no issue staying in a Medicaid pending status.\n&x200B\nIf there are any questionable gifts of large sums of money in the past 5 years (maybe longer in some states) that may make eligibility impossible."

        "prediction": "Yes, you are correct about the first question - the investment/interest rate is the rate at which you bought the security, while the yield takes into account any discount or premium received when purchasing a non-par bond.\nAnd yes, selecting one reinvestment means your principal plus interest will be automatically rolled over into a new six-month bill with whatever yield is available at that time. This is called a \"reinvestment option\".",
        "answer_1": "The difference between investment/ interest rate deals with the fact that you are buying this at a discount so in a normal bond you need to pay par to get back par back at maturity with coupons in between but since this is a discounted zero coupon you paid 98 dollar price so if you buy the full 1000 dollar which is the bond equivalent yield you would be at 2.50% .\nAlso at 1 reinvestment that mean it\u2019ll roll that I to the next 6 month bill but the level will be different depending on market conditions\nEdit calculation is below but general gist is the bond is at a zero coupon bond  discount that will generate higher bond equivalent yield(bey)",
        "answer_2": "I'm confused by where you are getting yield. Is that something you calculated? I don't see it on TreasuryDirect for my holdings.\nFor 1, \nInvestment/Interest Rate=(12.34/987.66)(365/(267))-1=2.505%\nYield should then be APY=(1+.02505/(365/(267)))^(365/(267))-1=2.52%\nFor 2, the security will reinvest on 8/8 at that auctions 26 week price. You'll get the ~$13 deposited into your account. Then in Feb 2020, you'll get the $1000 when the security matures and there are 0 reinvestments remaining."

My parents [Late 40s]  are first time home buyers but my dad just changed jobs and his credit isn\u2019t in the best shape right now therefore using him in the mortgage loan process will not work out. My mom has good credit but low income so she asked if I will cosign on a $229,999 property with her because I have good credit and currently working. The only thing is I work part time and I am also a full time student, I\u2019m thinking the job I have at the moment is not  stable enough to the point I can rely on my income although I won\u2019t be paying for the home and everything that comes along with owning one, my parents will.  Is this a risky decision? How can I tell my parents they are putting my financial life in jeopardy if it is?\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you!\n<|assistant|>\n",

Explain that while you love them, you cannot put your own financial future at risk.",

They are going to default. \nSide but important note: Do everything in your power to save and pay for school as you go with as few loans as possible - 100k of student loans sets you up to end college and have a loan repayment = house payment or rent without your having an apartment or house - and severely limiting your ability to get a home/rent. You\u2019ll be stuck living with parents or friends. and by the way?  Student loans are the 1 loan type you can never get out of via bankruptcy. They stick with you forever.

I was born into this settlement at the Brio Superfund site in Friendswood, Texas. The lump sums I received in 2005 paid for my education, I am now 28, 2 years into my career, married and contributing 10% towards my 401k matched 25% with no ceiling which I started in 2014. We are in the 25% tax bracket and I am in the process of saving a 6 month emergency fund along with one year of my wife's salary for her to be a stay at home mom when we have a child. My wife and I have joint accounts and we use YNAB budgeting system. We are renting-to-own our 180k home (purchased 2012) from her (rich) parents for only 400$ a month. The only debt we have is her car note which will be paid off by the end of this year.\nI am currently using this settlement money to expedite our emergency fund which I keep in a separate bank account so that it is more 'out of mind' and we are not tempted to spend it. I have no idea what to do with this money once our emergency fund is established. We are financially responsible to the point where we do not need to touch this money and can allow it to grow. Any and all tips are greatly appreciated. \nI have contemplated the idea of increasing my contributions to either my 401k or Roth (which is matched 25% as well) and making up the difference to my income with the monthly settlement money.\n<|assistant|>\n",

After maximizing your 401(k), then contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible. Again, since you're in the 25% tax bracket, this allows you to lower your taxable income.\n\n4. If you still have excess funds after step 3, then consider investing outside of retirement accounts. You could open a brokerage account and invest in low cost index funds/ETFs.\n\nRemember, always prioritize paying down high interest debt first before investing.

My wife was brought up well and has pretty good money sense. I on the other hand was homeless at 16, joined the military at 18(6 years of service), I was a heroin addict (7 years clean in Feb), spent some time in prison, spent more time being homeless, and have just kind of really started to get my shit together over the last 5 or so years. Rebuilding your life from scratch sucks, the only positive thing about hitting rock bottom was that I had a solid foundation to build the rest of my life on. \nI'm getting a raise from ~$31k/yr to ~$49k/yr. I've got an acorns account sitting at just under $400 with a moderately conservative portfolio, which I deposit $10/month into. I've got ~$65 in my savings account and a little under $700 in my checking account. \nMy mortgage is $1250/month and daycare is $1300/month, not to mention utilities, food, gas, and all that jazz. Bills and so forth are pretty much handled between my salary and my wife's. We've got no student loan debt, but we do have a vehicle that is ~$300/month with about 3 years left to pay on the lease.\nHow should I invest? Should I go with a more aggressive portfolio?

You mentioned you're feeling \"lost\" - this is actually great news because it means you're open to learning and improving. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. Emergency fund: Before investing, make sure you have enough saved for emergencies. Aim for three to six months' worth of expenses. This will give you peace of mind and prevent you from having to sell investments during market downturns.\n\n2. Pay off high-interest debt: Your car payment seems high for a lease. Consider refinancing to a lower interest rate or buying a used car instead. If you have credit card debt, prioritize paying that off before investing.\n\n3. Max out retirement accounts: Once you hit these milestones, start contributing as much as possible to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or Roth IRA. These will help you save for retirement while also reducing your taxes today.\n\n4. Build wealth through index funds: Instead of trying to pick individual stocks, focus on building a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds. This will provide long-term growth without the risk of picking losers.\n\n5. Teach your children about finance: As you said, you want to set a better example for your family. Start teaching them about saving, budgeting, and investing now.

I recently paid off the student loans that were directly in my name after 2 years and now I'm going to contribute to paying off that mountain.\nRight now my budget looks like this\nIncome $3960 per month (this is after taxes and assuming I don't work over time which I do at least 2 times a month)\nRent $899\nPhone $142 (it will be going down to $60 come Nov)\nInternet $20\nElectric $30\nHulu $8\nSaving $600\nAdobe CC $54 (I need this for work which makes me wonder if I can write it off on my taxes?)\nTransportation $116\nThat if my math is right means I have $2200~ left at the end of the month with some wobble room for food (which I left out because month to month what I spend on food widely varies) which just barely covers the minimum payment on the loans which based on my math means it would take me 9 years to pay them off and I would pay $74,521.93 in interest in that time which is crazy! Right now theres a balance of $488.13 in owed interest that I've set a payment for friday to pay off on top of the already scheduled required payment. \nSo I have two questions is there any feasible way for me to get a loan of equal value at a lower interest rate?

Of course one of the other factors is that this involves amortizing your loans over a longer period. Which means you will pay more in the long run and it will take longer to pay off the loans. This also means going from federal to private loans which reduces the payment deferral options available to you. But if the current payment plan just isn't working then you have to change something. \nI did a quick back of the envelope calculation of 185k principle at 8% with a 10 year amortization. The monthly payment amount I am calculating is around $2200 per month. So your parents' current loans do not appear to be on any sort of income based repayment plan. \nWhen you are ready to refi you will want to shop the loans around a bit.

        "prediction": "Whether it's better to lease or buy a car depends on your personal circumstances and preferences. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Upfront costs: Leasing typically requires lower upfront payments than buying because you're not paying the full purchase price of the vehicle. If you need to conserve cash flow right now, leasing may be more attractive.\n\n2. Monthly payments: Lease payments are usually lower than loan payments for an equivalent new car because you're only paying for the depreciation during the term of the lease (usually two to three years). However, at the end of the lease, you don't have any equity in the car, so you'll still owe something if you want to continue driving that make and model. Buying means you'll pay interest on the entire purchase price over time, but you'll build equity as you pay down the principal.\n\n3. Mileage limits: Most leases come with annual mileage restrictions. Exceeding those limits can result in extra fees. If you drive a lot each year, buying might be a better option since there are no mileage limitations.\n\n4. Maintenance: Leased cars often come with manufacturer warranties, which can save money on repairs. Once you own the car outright, you're responsible for all maintenance and repair costs.\n\n5. Flexibility: Leasing allows you to switch into a newer car every few years without having to sell your old one. This can be appealing if you like driving new vehicles frequently. Ownership provides more flexibility regarding modifications and customizations.\n\nUltimately, whether it's better to lease or buy comes down to what makes sense for your specific situation. Consider your financial goals, how long you plan to keep the car, and your driving habits before making a decision.",

Leading to all my debts being paid off. \nPF has been a strong force for me, just reading of stories and getting to realize that at the age of 27 I need to plan for my future. \nThen in October I started using YNAB which is great too.\nHere's how my budget looks like.

Lastly I pay all the bills and budget for food and else. \nIf there's something left, I go back to beginning and put 10% into savings etc.\nBudgeting for a laptop is quite aggressive since I don't have one and I need it for school.\n Around here we don't have 401k's and whatnot. I'll look more deeply into retirement savings, and investing, after establishing emergency fund. \nThis plan follows mostly my spending habits past year, except the savings category. \nWhat have I missed and where could I adjust?

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\n[US] Is it realistic to make a stable living from home? The reason I am asking is because I am nearly 30 now, and most of my life I have worked for minimum wage in NYC and can barely pay my rent, bills, expenses, etc. and would like to try and save some money by cutting my transportation costs by working from home. I currently work about 90-100 hours a week for $455/week, so I have no problem investing the same amount of work hours if the pay from home is going to be about the same, so that I will be saving money on commuting to work. However, most of the \"work from home!\" opportunities either 1) sound like scams, or 2) are not financially stable enough to depend on as an income. So is it viable to actually maintain a career from home, or am I pretty much stuck in my current employment position for the foreseeable future? Because I don't have any marketable job skills that employers will be wanting to pay more for, and also after I finish work and all my responsibilities are tended to, I don't have much time left over to invest in a new employable skill such as programming.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Unfortunately, based on your description, it doesn't seem likely that you'll be able to make a stable living from home with your current situation. Working 90-100 hours a week at minimum wage means you're already stretched thin, and there aren't many legitimate work-from-home jobs that pay minimum wage (or even close to it).\n\nTo make a stable living from home, you need to develop marketable skills that are in demand and command higher wages. This takes time and effort, but it's necessary if you want to improve your financial situation. You may consider looking into online courses, bootcamps, or certifications to help you acquire these skills. It won't happen overnight, but it's worth considering as a long-term solution rather than relying on shortcuts or quick fixes.",
        "answer_1": "It is hard for me to believe that you work 90-100 hours a week in NYC of all places and only make $455/wk. That would make no sense due to OT laws and the fact that the minimum wage there is higher than many places in America even though it's a HCOL area. That part just sounds phony as heck. \nTo answer your question though the answer is yes, many people actually work from home. Create a website, youtube, finding legit companies that allow you to work from home, etc. You just need some type of skill set and a way to market your product. It is still work at the end of the day though. \nBy the way, if you truly do work 90-100 hours per week as you claim, it sounds like it could be illegal since NYC'S minimum wage is $11.00 per hour and at 40 hours that's $440 now add that plus overtime of 50-60 hours per week and that's $1265-$1430 per week and if no overtime that's still double what you claimed to make at $990 per week. Check your taxes, withholdings, etc, because unless you are illegal you are getting ripped off by half your check. ",

Don't make the mistake of thinking you can just skip that step because you have some extra money now.\nThat being said, if you really want to buy a place, you should still calculate whether you can afford the monthly mortgage payments *and* continue saving for emergencies at the same time. Just because you're eligible for a no-downpayment loan doesn't mean you should take it - think about how much house you can truly afford based on your income and expenses.\nIn general, PF recommends having 3-6 months of expenses saved up before making any large purchases like buying a house. So unless you expect to find a new job within the next few months, I would prioritize building up that emergency fund over putting it towards a down payment right away.",

Here's my checklist:\n\nA solid emergency fund including mortgage and other housing costs.\nNo high interest rate debts.\nAble to continue saving 15% or more for retirement.\nA 20% down payment to avoid PMI and prove that you can actually afford it.  (How are you going to be able to afford a house if you can't even scrape together a good down payment before taking on all of those costs?)\nA good credit score and a decent mortgage rate (relative to current mortgage market).\nEnough income to pay mortgage and other costs.  If you plan on becoming a single-income household in the future, this must be considered before you buy a house.\nNo intention to move for at least 5 years.\nEnough time to maintain and care for a home.\nAbility to find an affordable place close enough to work.  Long commute times make almost everyone really unhappy.\nBuying a house should be economically superior to renting in your situation (i.e., check the NYT rent-vs-buy calculator).\nYou should actually want a house rather than just following someone else's checklist of what you need to be a complete person.\n\nI don't know much about VA home loans, but I would still save a much more significant down payment than \"nothing\" before buying a home.\nI hope this helps.\nP.S. For what it's worth, I don't hate Dave Ramsey, I just don't think he gives great advice after baby step 4 or so, I think he gives bad recommendations around FAs and actively managed mutual funds, and I think he sets unrealistic expectations for market returns.  His advice is well-designed for people with bad debt problems, though.",
        "answer_2": "There's nothing wrong with the idea of paying off debt (although it's not always the optimal choice, it's generally a good idea regardless).\nWhere people tend to differ with him here is his insistence on not getting credit cards and his investment advice, which tends to be wildly overly optimistic as far as the return you can expect, the withdrawal rate you can use in retirement, and which tends to point people to terrible funds with ridiculously high fees.\nOh and some people (rightly) note that the debt snowball method isn't mathematically optimal, but if it keeps people digging themselves out then who am I to judge?\nJust the idea of paying off debt and saving money? Nobody here is going to get on you or anyone else for doing that. Good job on paying down your debts, definitely build up your emergency fund, and if you choose to invest do so through Vanguard/Schwab/Fidelity, not through an ELP (loads or expense ratios of over about 0.50% are blatant highway robbery and should not be supported)."

I have been very fortunate as I found a SWE job in NYC and my saving during college has allowed me to pay off my student loans quickly. Recently, I have been coming down on a pretty hard post college depression. I have been saving a ton of money, with no clear objective. I really appreciate my family allowing me to stay home as I try to save up, but its taxing on my social life/ self confidence. \nI really want to have my own place, my own area where I can work in peace and have friends over when I'd like, bring home a girl if I want to. But every damn person I talk to, tells me to save up while you can, it'll be worth it. \nI'm all for saving up while I can, and I can accept that a little bit of sacrifice right now will do me well in the future. But it seems like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. \nA seemingly distant goal I have is to save up enough to afford a down payment on a co-op/condo, where I would be able to do some house-hacking on it and semi-cover my mortgage with the money renting out another room. However, we live in NYC and a down-payment on a condo in Brooklyn costs over 100k, a seemingly un-achievable goal within the next 2-3 years. \nI have set up all the recommended investment accounts (401k/ Roth) and maxed out the contributions towards those every year.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nIf I have debt, should I be saving anything? Say I have 15k in revolving credit card debt at an 11% APR.  Should I be focused on paying that off before I even consider contributing to a savings or 401k?  It doesn't seem like there is any investment out there where I could make 11% interest from and so the best investment I can make is to pay down my debts.  My employer does not match my 401k.\nI'm 28 and have a 200k mortgage and while I make an effort to pay down my credit card debt, I'll usually splurge and charge a handful of big expenses throughout the year and end up at the same place come tax time.  I want to start contributing to my retirement savings but based on my reasoning above it doesn't seem to make sense.  Would another option be to invest in property, since it's more liquid and could possible generate income if I've got renters who are paying more than my mortgage?  Even so, any invest is not likely to give the 11% return rate that debt reduction would.\nTL;DR; Am I right to pay off all my debts before I consider any investments?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, you should focus on paying off your high-interest debt first. Saving for retirement comes after getting rid of debt with such a high interest rate. Investing in property as a way to pay off debt is not a good idea - buying rental properties requires significant capital and expertise, which you don't appear to have. Focus on creating a budget, cutting back on unnecessary spending, and making a plan to pay off your debt as quickly as possible. Once your debt is under control, then you can think about investing for retirement.",
        "answer_1": "Yes, pay off the credit card debt as soon as possible.  You're just giving the bank money.\nGet a working budget in order, stop \"splurging\" and spending money that you don't have.  You're still young, so learn early, get some self discipline and it will make your life forward go a lot easier.",
        "answer_2": "\nWould another option be to invest in property, since it's more liquid\n\nNo. It's not more liquid.\n1) You can't just \"withdraw\" money from a house. You either sell it or you keep it.\n2) Selling takes time, effort, and money. Withdrawing money from a 401k just takes money. Since you likely won't need the entire amount of the house, the penalties from the 401k might actually be cheaper than the fees incurred from selling the house.\nAlso, do you get employer match on the 401k?\nPay off your credit cards aggressively. Then cut it up or freeze them in the freezer so you don't use them. Only buy something if you have cash for it.\nYou should not be saving anything besides a 6 month emergency fund. Most people say 3-6, but I think 6 is better if you own a house. You might have to do emergency repairs. And if you lose your income, you'll want a buffer since, again, a house is difficult to get rid of."

I also want them to learn restraint so they don't get into deep.  I figured I can do this with allowances.  But I want to take it several steps further.  \nThey are young now, so since I plan on giving them $5/week allowance, I'll actually give them $20, but have them pay me for certain things like rent, food, etc.  I want to keep it fun for them, but when all the bills are paid, the remaining $5 is theirs to keep.  As they get older, I can change thing up and add an in-house \"checking account\" and even make it that they can take out loans.  The goal is to teach, not make them pay me...  since it's my money anyway.\nI'm thinking that if done right, not only will it be fun for them, it will teach them how to handle money.  Like if they pay bill late, there is a penalty.  Or if they want something expensive and take out a loan, it hurts to pay it back each week (cut's into the allowance)\nSo what are your thoughts?

That sends mixed messages.\n\n3. A weekly allowance of $5 isn't enough to teach much about managing money. It's barely enough to cover a single meal at a fast-food restaurant.\n\n4. Penalties for paying bills late might seem like a good idea, but it could easily spiral into resentment and arguments over small amounts of money.\n\nInstead, consider these alternatives:\n\n1. Teach financial literacy through conversation and example, rather than by forcing them into artificial situations. Explain why you save money, how you manage bills, and what choices you make when faced with expenses.\n\n2. Give them a larger allowance (say, $20-$30 per week), and let them decide how to spend it. Encourage saving, but avoid micromanaging every purchase.\n\n3. Discuss wants vs. Needs, and help them understand the difference between the two. This will prepare them for making smart decisions later in life.\n\n4. Avoid using money as a punishment or reward. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement for good behavior and decision-making skills.\n\nRemember, the goal is to raise financially responsible adults, not to turn childhood into adulthood.",
        "answer_1": "I disagree with \"charging\" them. I could see that backfiring when they find out that their friends don't have to pay bills. Kids shouldn't be paying bills. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be teaching them the value of a dollar.\nHere are some of my suggestions:\n1.) Implement a chore chart and reward system. The chore chart will be based on their abilities and ages. Each day, they have chores to complete, and at the end of the week if they have completed all of their chores, they receive their allowance. \n2.) Allowance can be age-based, but doesn't have to be. For example, I wouldn't feel the need to give a 5 year old $5 weekly. They would be content with a dollar. \n3.) Each child should have a savings account. When they get their weekly allowance, double it. They put the double into their savings account. \n4.) Teach them about the \"Parent Credit Plan\". This is a fake credit card system. They can borrow money from you, but they have to pay it back within x amount of time. If they're late, that's okay, but they either have to pay a late fee, or do an extra chore. \n5.) Once they are old enough to work, they should be. It's important to work in retail for many reasons, but one key reason is learning about money. Encourage them to continue to contribute to their savings account. Have them set up a checking account with direct deposit, and teach them to set up an automatic transfer to savings. \n6.) Finally, once they are in their teens, look for a local financial 101 class. I imagine they might be offered by school districts and libraries.

        "answer_2": "I like your idea and it is similar to an idea my dad implemented. He was giving me $2 a week in middle school (1990) I was 11. I complained because my friends seemed to be getting about $5 a week on average. When I complained he told me he would give $42 a month, a large upgrade on the average my friends were getting. However, I had to pay for my own shoes and he budgeted for me to pay for 2 lunches at school per week within the $42/month. It was $1.25 for lunch at the time. He also told me I could pack my own lunch for free whenever I wanted. Guess who started making a $30 pair of shoes last a year? Guess who stopped eating school lunches? Guess who started stockpiling money? Guess who has zero resentment for his parent 23 years later? I was able to start saving enough money to pay for my own computer. I was not responsible for \"rent\" or \"electric bill\" or food in general. I was responsible for a couple of items that children or pre-teens can certainly handle. I learned a valuable lesson. I have known how to save money since I was 11. I will be implementing a similar program with my kids when they appear to be ready.\nIn general, though, I do agree with the other comments on this thread that are talking about you giving them $20 and then taking back $15 for necessities you provide. I don't think that is the best idea. Give them the allowance, tell them what their allowance covers, and be strong to not give them extra money for those things included in the allowance. My parents would sometimes give me an advance on the next week's allowance when it got close to the next \"pay period,\" but I think they should have skimmed %5 off the top like a payday advance might.\nHow old are they?

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance because all the charts Ive seen and budget posts on here always say to max 401k first but for some reason that just doesn't stick well in my head that I should be putting every penny left over into retirement. \nI'm also saving some in a savings account for a house purchase if that is relevant.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "There are several good reasons to contribute to a taxable brokerage account before maximizing your retirement accounts:\n\n1. You want access to your money - While you can't touch your retirement accounts until age 59\u00bd (with some exceptions) without paying taxes and penalties, you can take money out of a taxable brokerage account at any time for any reason with no restrictions or penalties. This makes it useful for short-term goals like buying a house, starting a business, or covering an emergency expense.\n\n2. You have already contributed the maximum to your retirement accounts - If you're already maxing out both your 401(k) and IRA, then contributing more to those accounts won't do anything for you right now. By investing in a taxable account instead, you can still continue growing your wealth while leaving room for future retirement contributions.\n\n3. Your employer doesn't offer a match - Some employers don't offer matching contributions to their 401(k), which means you're missing out on free money by focusing solely on retirement accounts. In this situation, it may make more sense to prioritize your taxable investments so you can still save for retirement and build up an emergency fund.\n\n4. You expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement - If you think you'll earn less income when you retire than you do now, then contributing to a taxable account might actually result in lower overall taxes since you'd pay capital gains taxes rather than ordinary income taxes.\n\nThat being said, you should still aim to maximize your retirement accounts as much as possible. The benefits of compound interest and tax-deferred growth far outweigh the flexibility of a taxable account. Just remember that having multiple investment accounts isn't necessarily a bad thing; it allows you to diversify your portfolio and gives you more options depending on your needs.",
        "answer_1": "The ability to access the money at any time for any reason if you have uses for it other than retirement is pretty much a catch all for all the reasons.  If your total financial plan assumes you'll have an adequate amount in retirement, then there's no reason to overfund the tax advantaged accounts and underfund the taxable.",
        "answer_2": "Should I buy a house or rent?  Should I max out my tax sheltered account or invest in a taxable account?\nThere is no right answer.   What is your goal?  If your only goal is retirement then max out the retirement accounts.  If on the other hand you want to start a business, buy a house, go on an around the world cruise then investing in a taxable account might be right for you.\nI'm retired, I have a boatload of $ in a traditional IRA.  But guess what, I am living off of my taxable account right now and have been for the last 3 years.  Why, because it makes tax sense to take capital gains when my rate is zero and let the tax free accounts continue to grow.  \nThere is no one right answer.  "

Both are seen as unavoidable transition fuels as an immediate shift away from oils is unrealistic. This makes Shell quite resilient for the upcoming 20 years. Don\u2019t know whether this is a good buy right now but I personally think that oil prices will go up in a few months time (having the combination of restored demand after corona and taking into account that Saudi Arabia needs $80/bbl for a closing government budget and Russia $50/bbl, making the current situation very unsustainable for both). Also, Shell is a high dividend stock and they have not deviated from that policy in the last decades. This should give investors some comfort.",
        "answer_2": "I think most oil companies will be a good long-term bet as long as they stay in business. Oil majors are safe, they're used to weathering situations like this. Russia will eventually come to the table because even they're going to be getting hit hard. The longer they hold out on a deal, the more damage is done to their economy. Eventually OPEC will be forced to make a coordinated cut. If everyone cuts a little, everyone wins. You end up pumping less oil and making more money compared to pumping high amounts at low oil prices."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nInsurance is trying to charge me 10x more than my normal copay for a doctors office since I haven\u2019t hit my deductible yet. About a month ago I had to go into my doctors office to get a medical form for my work. The doctor went over it with me and signed me off, it was maybe about 30 minutes. I had paid my copay and didn\u2019t think anything of it. Apparently the doctor had billed me for an \u201cextended amount of time\u201d for a doctors appointment. They sent a large bill to my insurance. My insurance covered about 20% of the bill and left the rest for me. This is an in-network doctor. But the thing was, I knew exactly what I needed. It should have been a 5 minute appointment. I had scheduled just a normal doctors visit and ultimately just had to get the work form signed which was the only thing that happened besides me again repeating symptoms I had and the doctor kept asking me questions. My insurance said that since I\u2019m still in my deductible phase that my normal office visit copay doesn\u2019t apply. This doesn\u2019t seem right. Any advice? \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Unfortunately, this does sound correct. When you're in your deductible phase, your insurer isn't responsible for covering any costs until you meet your deductible. Your copay is not a payment towards your deductible - it's simply a set fee you pay at the time of service. In this case, because the doctor coded the visit as something other than a routine checkup (which would be subject to your lower copay), you'll need to pay the full balance until you reach your deductible.",
        "answer_1": "This is how high deductible plans work. If the appointment was not considered \"preventative care,\" which is usually covered, then it goes to the deductible first. The 20% off you are seeing is probably a negotiated lower rate for in-network care.",

After that, you only have to pay a small fee for each treatment (copay) and/or perhaps a smaller percentage (coinsurance).\n\nApparently the doctor had billed me for an \u201cextended amount of time\u201d for a doctors appointment\n\nIf you disagree with how they billed it, you would have to take that up with the doctor's office."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nThe Best Financial Decision I Ever Made... I've been wanting to write this for awhile and figured with the recent market turmoil and people social distancing (redditing), now might be a good time to reach some open minds.\nReal Estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion in this sub so please consider if this isn't for you, it doesn't mean it's not helpful to someone. This post is for anyone that is willing to consider real estate as part of their portfolio.\nI'm talking about holding physical real estate with a bank loan or mortgage. If that's not for you, consider REITs. Personally, I don't own any REITs since I own physical real estate but they have consistently proved to be less volatile and more profitable than total market indexes. [Average REIT Returns vs Stocks Over Long Periods]( \nIn truth, physical real estate is one of the most powerful and accessible tools for people with common jobs to build wealth. I don't need to rehash why, as hundreds of articles have done before. [Why Real Estate Builds Wealth More Consistently Than Other Asset Classes]( \nLastly, below's an illustration of a recent change I made that I hope resonates with the younger FIRE community. I went from living in a shared 2-bedroom apartment to a one-bedroom apartment, and am saving an extra $1296 per month doing it. How so? I invested $62k and bought a multi-family home, living in one unit and renting out the other 3. Don't have $62k for a down payment? You probably qualify for a FHA loan for 3.5% down. Below is my expense breakdown for the first month of ownership. My only regret is not doing it sooner... and cashing on in the current 3% 30-year fixed mortgage.\n[ \nThere's lots of advice about churning credit cards, cut out cable, reduce their cellphone bill, etc for a few hundred bucks a year. What about looking at your unused or underutilized assets. In this real estate focused post, that could mean renting out and extra room or garage.\nWhile I love my VTSAX for it's simplicity and returns, I expect this investment will have 2-4x the returns of VTSAX and add diversification to my portfolio.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "This is great content! Here are some additional points:\n\n1) Leverage: Borrowing money to invest in real estate can magnify your returns. For example, let's say you put 20% ($62,000) down on a property worth $310,000 and finance the rest with a 30-year mortgage at 3%. Your cash flow is $780/month after expenses, but your return on invested capital is over 10% annually. Compare that to a 10% annual return in the stock market where you have to fund 100% of the purchase price.\n\n2) Tax benefits: Rental properties provide tax deductions for mortgage interest, depreciation, and repairs. These can significantly lower your taxable income and increase your overall after-tax returns.\n\n3) Cash flow: While stocks may go up over time, they do not produce monthly cash flow like rental properties do. This allows you to live off passive income instead of having to work forever.\n\n4) Diversification: Adding real estate to your portfolio provides another asset class besides stocks and bonds. It also tends to perform differently during economic downturns, providing a hedge against recessions.\n\n5) Appreciation: Real estate has historically appreciated over time, although this should not be relied upon as a primary source of return. However, it does allow for leveraged appreciation due to the use of debt.\n\nOverall, real estate investing is not for everyone, but it should definitely be considered by those who want to take control of their finances and build long-term wealth.",
        "answer_1": "You say \"real estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion\" like it's some sort of conspiracy against real estate.\nReal estate is a great option, but it tends to be irrationally overhyped and backed up by shady numbers. Your post, unfortunately, isn't much of an exception. Anyone saying that ANY investment will have 2x4x the returns of VTSAX over the long term is selling snake oil.\nBut also some of the monthly numbers fall into the same traps that I see over an over again:\n\nThey compare leveraged RE numbers versus unleveraged equity numbers.\nThey don't include time costs\nThey either don't include maintenance costs or vastly underestimate them.\nThe don't include risks of evictions, non-payment, and vacancies. (This is one of the things that worries me the most. People who cannot pay the mortgage without the rental income are people who will get into serious trouble sooner or later.)\nThey make very optimistic assumptions about rental income rates. It varies market to market, but most rental rates aren't going to cover mortage+tax+insurance, let alone mortgage+tax+insurance+maintenance+transaction costs+capital costs. Active real estate investment is a generally a long game where your eventual profit comes via capital gains and rent increases.\n\nAgain, let me be 100% clear, I am not against real estate investing. I just think that it is often portrayed with very rose colored glasses on investment boards. Sure, if you can find an excellent property, with excellent tenants, and excellent appreciation you will make out great. But, just like stocks, not every pick is a winner and it's harder to get diversification when owning properties directly. Unfortunately, I think we only hear from the winners and not the losers so we get a biased perspective.",

This allows you to capture the benefits of all these asset classes while still keeping things simple with relatively few investments.\n\nThe exact mix will depend on factors like your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, but most financial advisors recommend having at least some portion of your portfolio outside of just the S&P 500.",

I'm 22, finishing up college with no student loans or any debt due to scholarship. I had the privilege of being able to work jobs in my field throughout college and summers (including Co-ops) and have all that money go straight into my savings account.\nFor the past ~6 years, whenever I have had more than $800 in my checking account, I move the difference into my savings. Now that I am graduating, it's sitting at about $20,000. I set up the savings account when I got into college, and I don't really understand it. For example, I moved $3000 into it at the beginning of January and the next day I got $6.24 in interest on 1/24. I moved another $450 over a few days later and on 2/24 I got $7.33 in interest. I haven't moved any money over since then, and on 3/24 got $0.83 in interest. I use a Southern regional bank called BancorpSouth... I love them because they're really good with security (I get calls about my own purchases saying \"this isn't like you, can you authorize this?\" or \"we don't have any indication you would be making a purchase in this state, can you authorize this?\" just from going two states over). However when I've traveled out of the South, sometimes I haven't had access to an ATM without crazy fees, so I feel like I need a more nationally (& internationally) available bank.\nI'm inherently frugal and hard working, but never really paid attention to finances.

First off, I'm not new to reddit, but I am going through a wretched divorce and have created a new username since my STBX knows my old username.  \nI have rented a house for myself and my kids with the intentions of being here a couple of years, until I can get my divorce done and finances in shape enough to buy a place of my own.  I have previously owned a home on my own, and with my STBX, however he has gotten us into so much debt that my credit isn't in good enough shape to buy, and we really need to focus on paying down the debt he created and our divorce before I even consider buying a place of my own.

Come to find out, this house is going into foreclosure (the bank delivered some paperwork here from the loan remediation dept and my friend who does mortgages was able to somehow look up the house online and find out that the owners are in fact in default on their loan- public records, she didn't do anything shady).  I mail my landlord the rent each month.  I never see them- I am responsible for snow removal and yard maintenance per my lease- but I did call to let him know he had a letter from Bank Of America and he asked that I leave it out by the front door and he would be by to get it.

Market Timing: Many people try to time the market instead of investing consistently over long periods.

These emotional decisions often result in subpar performance.\n\n4. Lack of Diversification: Some people put all their money into one stock or sector, thinking it will be a home run.

The high interest ones are the ones that her parents took out and account for about 2/3's of the debt.  Currently she is living at home and is making about 60k a year but has to commute from 1 hour to 1 and a half hours. I have checked some websites and believe that you cannot consolidate Stafford Parent Loans.  Please correct me if I am wrong. \nSo basically she is paying her parents loans first (due to high interest) before attempting to tackle hers. She knows that her parents probably used some of that money for their own purposes but she is still willing to pay for it. Her parents aren't in the best financial shape but has a lot of money overseas if only they asked one of their relatives for it. (technically it was suppose to be one of the parent's but he/she decided to let their relative keep it).\nI do want to marry this girl someday but her debt is not something I look forward to.\nWould it be possible to take a lower interest loan and pay off the parent's debt? \n<|assistant|>\n",

If they refuse to help or acknowledge the issue, then she may need to make a difficult choice between continuing to subsidize them or prioritizing her own finances.",

If she did so, she simply needs to pay it back. The fact she enables her family is irrelevant.\nIf your girlfriend never agreed to be responsible for the debt, then her parents committed a crime and she needs to report the fraud. It sucks to have terrible parents who would victimize their child like this, but enabling them by ignoring it will help no one.\nDid she pay for a substantial portion of her education? There does not need to be much mystery here. If she did not, she just needs to do some basic math.\nTotal Cost of Education - Scholarships - Grants - Amount She Paid= Amount Paid For With Loans\nIf that number is 65k+, then it went to finance her education. \nIf she is living at home, she should utilize almost her entire paycheck every month to pay it off in about 2 years.",

        "prediction": "While it's possible to create your own will using do-it-yourself kits, online templates, or other non-lawyer resources, I strongly recommend against it. Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Complexity: Wills can be complex documents that require an understanding of legal terminology and procedures. Small mistakes in a DIY will could result in unintended consequences for your beneficiaries.\n\n2. Legal requirements: Each state has its own laws governing wills, and failure to follow those rules could render your document invalid. A lawyer knows these rules and how to apply them correctly.\n\n3. Asset protection: Your will should not only distribute assets but also protect them from creditors, taxes, and disputes. An experienced attorney can help you structure your will to achieve this goal.\n\n4. Emotional issues: Creating a will involves making difficult decisions about who gets what and when. A lawyer can provide objective guidance and help you navigate emotional challenges.\n\n5. Peace of mind: Knowing that your will was prepared by a professional gives you peace of mind that everything is done right. It also reduces the likelihood of family conflicts after you pass away.\n\nIn short, while it may seem cheaper to prepare your own will, the risks and potential costs of getting it wrong far outweigh any savings. Invest in a qualified estate planning attorney to ensure your wishes are carried out as intended.",

Should I start my own retirement fund? Basically, I contribute a large amount of my paycheck to a pension plan which I cannot opt out of (around 15% every two weeks). If I stay with the government for 35 years or so, I'll get a pretty decent pension at around 80% of my income until I die.\nBut I'm also 28 right now, and I have no idea if I want to work for the government for the rest of my life. But I've been working for them since I was 25 and have no real retirement savings of my own, so I don't really know what to do if I leave.

This way, if you need to adjust your plans or encounter unexpected expenses, you won't be tied up with an early repayment penalty.\n\n2. Interest rates: The interest rate on your current mortgage is relatively low, so there isn't necessarily a huge benefit to paying it off quickly. Instead, you may want to focus on building up your emergency fund and saving for a larger down payment on your next home.\n\n3. Equity: You do have significant equity built up in your current home, which can help you when buying your next one. However, don't assume that this will automatically translate into a large sum of cash - closing costs, realtor fees, moving expenses, etc., all eat away at your profits.\n\nUltimately, only you know what makes the most sense for your specific circumstances.

The equity in your current home is useless in the initial purchase (although it can be great for a subsequent refi). I would save it in a high-yield savings account, or possibly in CDs (with maturity planned for when you'll start house hunting).\nA five year time horizon puts a lot of risk on an investment - it's not long enough to ensure that it doesn't temporarily lose significant value by the time you need it.

When she first told me they were inheriting his debt I told her that you don't inherit debt (at least I'm pretty sure?) but she said that it was really the business they were inheriting, and with that a lot of money owed.\nAs for how his smallish business got into so much debt, I'm not sure.

Check their ratings on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website.\n2. Get multiple offers: Contact a few different dealers and ask for quotes. Compare the prices offered by each one.\n3. Sell directly to a refiner: If you're selling large quantities of gold or platinum, consider selling it directly to a refinery instead of a dealer. This will eliminate the middleman markup.\n4. Avoid mail-in offers: Be wary of companies that offer to buy your gold through the mail. These often come with high fees and low prices.\n5. Know the value: Before you sell anything, make sure you understand its true value based on current market prices. Don't let a dealer talk you into accepting less than what it's actually worth.\n6. Consider selling the items yourself: If your grandmother's jewelry is sentimental but not particularly valuable, consider selling it privately rather than to a dealer.

They buy at something like 98 or 99% spot price.  \nI'm a metal detectorist and when MDers need to sell their gold they have found, this is what most people do.  Pawn shops or jewelry shops are going to get your metals for as little as possible, they will rip you off. \nThere is a bit of a process... you have to ship it to them and you certainly wany that to be insured.  You can give them a call and I'm sure they will walk you through the process.  \nRemember too that they refine the stuff, i.e. melt it down and remove any alloys (other stuff in jewelery that isn't gold) and you get paid for the actual volume of the precious metals.

In my experience, coin shops are better than pawn/jewelry shops, but your mileage may vary.  I would never sell without getting at least 95% of that days spot price, and I would always sell if I could get 99% of the days spot price.  That's my acceptable range.  \nTalk with a tax preparer before you sell.  It sounds like you need to sell this to pay current expenses, but you should know the tax issues before you sell.  My guess is that you would sell now, any tax burden would go to grandma, but her income is low, and there might be deductions that make the income from the sale largely deductible."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nReally need your help in an important decision (CA) Hi, this is my first post and I thought it'd be great to ask for more advices from you guys. \nMy father owns a commercial property. The tenant wants to renew the lease for another 10 years. Basic info about the tenant: sends us prepaid cheques for the entire year, no trouble, polite man, pays on time. \nHere's the tricky question: for the renewal lease, the tenant is willing to assume all the payments for property tax, GST/QST sales taxes, school taxes, mortgage and insurance - all these costs are fixed costs that must be paid yearly and adds up to roughly $40K. The annual rent income will be around $60K. This is for the next upcoming 10 years. On our side, we won't have much expenses to pay since it's all consumed by the tenant and I assume my net income would be 60K-5K= 55K.\nNow my father wants to add another condition \"net,net,net\" on top of the things mentioned earlier, meaning the tenant must now pay for their own major repairs and every other future costs. Obviously, the tenant is unwilling to do that now. We are still negotiating at this moment.\nWhat would you do if you were in my place: push the tenant to accept the \"net,net,net\" condition or sign the lease anyways without that \"net,net,net\" condition? \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As an armchair financial advisor, here's what I would say:\n\nDo not give away free money.\n\nThe tenant offering to cover all those expenses is a significant benefit to you. You should strongly consider signing the lease as written, unless there are some major issues with the tenant that you haven't shared. Adding a \"net,net,net\" clause could potentially scare off a good tenant and leave you back where you started.\n\nThat being said, make sure you understand the full implications of such a long lease term. Tenant relationships can change over time, so locking yourself into a decade-long agreement may not be ideal either. Consult with a real estate attorney before making a final decision.",

Raise the rent accordingly.\nI have no opinion on the triple net.\nGood luck.",

A bit of background, my wife was a teenager during the recession, and her family was hit pretty hard since her dad works as a real estate appraiser. They went from having a really comfortable life to having nothing for several years. There were a lot of nights they went hungry.

Additionally, even when things were going well, they didnt live like they were rich and were very frugal, also another thing my wife is proud of. \nBut now my wife has this mentality where she is afraid of me making too much money. She is afraid of saving/investing too much. Because of the way she grew up, she has it in her head that having more than enough money is somehow bad. My desires for having greater wealth is to 1. Provide for our own family and live comfortably 2. Use the excess to help others and save for the future needs of our children and grandchildren.

        "prediction": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending can be a viable investment option for some people, but it's not suitable for everybody. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Risk: P2P lending involves lending money directly to individuals or small businesses, which carries higher risks than investing in traditional financial products like stocks and bonds. Default rates vary widely by platform, so do your research beforehand.\n\n2. Diversification: To mitigate the risk of default, it's important to spread your investments across multiple borrowers rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. Some platforms offer automated diversification tools that help with this.\n\n3. Liquidity: Unlike a bank account, there may be restrictions on when and how you can access your funds. Be sure to understand the terms of withdrawal before committing any capital.\n\n4. Returns: While returns can be attractive compared to other low-risk investments, they also come with higher volatility due to the underlying credit risk. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the expected return and potential losses.\n\n5. Regulation: The industry is still relatively new and unregulated in many countries, so make sure you choose a reputable platform with proper consumer protections.\n\nOverall, I would recommend doing thorough research and consulting with a financial advisor if you're unsure whether P2P lending is right for you.",
        "answer_1": "It may well be an excellent addition to a diversified portfolio. Personally though I won't touch it until it's gone through at least one crisis-and-subsequent-regulation cycle. At the top of my mind:\n\n\nWhile some P2P companies are actually P2P, most look a lot like banks. They allow investors to deposit/withdraw money very quickly, while the loans they make are for multiple years. This plus a lack of regulation (and associated capital requirements) makes me nervous.\n\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the companies have 'provision funds' which compensate investors in the case some of their loans default. These funds typically run to a few percentage points of the loans made. This seems like something that will fail spectacularly in bad times, and some companies have strange protocols on what to do when that happens.\n\n\nMany of the companies are looking to seize as much market share as possible, and I suspect this will drive them to silently lower the creditworthiness of their lendees. Look at how the sale of MBS drove banks to give mortgages to people who really shouldn't have had mortgages.\n\n\nHere's a good article that details a lot of the issues:",
        "answer_2": "No.\nHere's why:\nBasically, P2P lending is high risk for the lender and the interest rates demanded reflect that reality.  Additionally, interest rates can be jacked up (oh, you might be promised (\"as much as\") a 10% return, but the actual interest rate could be as high as 20%, which is in payday loan territory).  The main problem with P2P lending is what happens at default.  Usually the organizing company tells you \"sorry, better luck next time, now fuck off and here's how to write it off on your taxes\".  Meanwhile, they go after the debtor over the long term to recover \"their\" money, of which you will never see a dime.  The second failure mode is that they stick their snout into the borrower's cash flow via factoring agreements in the contract at the first missed payment.  They then settle your half of the loan at a below par rate (you were promised \"as much as 10%\", but they report the missed payment, say the borrow is in default and give you 2%... you should just be happy you got your money+2% back... meanwhile they're consistently extracting 7% each month via factoring)."

My rents are $1,100 for a 2/1 unit and $900 for a 1/1 unit.  The neighboring duplex has exactly the same layout.  The owners inherited the property, and they haven't raised rents in the past decade, from before the neighborhood became desirable.  Currently the rents are $700 for the 2/1 and $550 for the 1/1.  \nIf I end up buying the place, I'd obviously want to get the rents to a market rate.

For example, if your unit goes from $1100 to $1400, increase theirs to around $850-$950 instead of $1200. This will help them adjust more easily.\n- Communicate clearly: Explain why the rent is going up, be transparent about your plans for the property, and emphasize that you value them as longtime tenants. Letting them know early gives them time to find another place if necessary.\n- Follow through: If you say you'll raise the rent over several months, make sure you do so.

Maybe a few months on utilities.  Maybe rent/mortgage payments for the property, maybe the last paycheck for employees?  Well you are on the hook for all of that, and can't afford it so you declare bankruptcy.  you couldn't afford it so you just tell everyone \"I don't have the money to pay you\" and all (well, most) of your debt is forgiven.

Water tanks can also be unsightly and may affect your property value when you decide to sell. However, since the distance between the house and the tower seems reasonable, and the fact that the tower is set back and hidden by trees, these factors might mitigate those concerns somewhat. As for flooding, living near a water tower does not necessarily mean increased risk of flooding - it's more related to where the water flows during heavy rainfall. You should still check whether the area is prone to flooding before making a decision. Ultimately, only you can weigh the pros and cons based on your personal preferences and priorities.",

My name is Sean and I am in a bit of a crisis. If I want to go to my 1 college choice (which is already pretty much off the table) I'd have to put in $5,000 by August just for my first year. Even if I don't go to that school, I'd likely need a similar amount of money because my parents are already paying for my older sister's college. My job at my local park district that pays $11/hr is only seasonal in the summer months, so I went without a job for a bit until January when I applied for a lifeguarding position at the same park district. Actually, I'd applied for 3 jobs based on the park district's openings in November but didn't hear anything from them. I got the lifeguard position in early January, and the \"aquatics manager\" (head lifeguard) said he'd reach out to me when training would be. I received an email saying training would be the last weekend of January. The day before, I emailed him to see what time it would be at, and he said it's now going to be the next weekend. Ok, that's fine. I emailed him today to see what time it would be this weekend, and he told me it was being moved to next weekend. I'm going out of town next weekend, and coincidentally the next weekend as well. I can't wait until the end of the month to start a job that was supposed to start in January.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nWhy is having bonds considered such an important part of a balanced portfolio? On top of that I am having trouble wrapping my head around what makes a bond \"good\" and how to evaluate them compared to each other?\nSecond follow up question. Does anyone have a favorite long term bond ETF they would recommend researching?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "A balanced portfolio includes both stocks (equities) and bonds (fixed-income securities). Bonds are considered an important part because:\n\n1. Diversification: Stocks and bonds tend to move differently in different market conditions, so adding bonds can help reduce the overall risk of your portfolio.\n2. Income: Bonds provide regular income payments through interest, which can be especially appealing during retirement or for those who need current cash flow.\n3. Capital preservation: While stocks offer higher potential returns over time, bonds generally have lower volatility and less risk of loss, making them a good choice for more conservative investors.\n\nWhen evaluating bonds, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. Credit quality: This refers to the likelihood that the issuer will repay the principal and interest on the bond. Higher credit quality bonds (such as AAA rated) carry less risk but also lower yields, while lower credit quality bonds (such as high yield or junk bonds) offer higher yields but greater risk.\n2. Maturity date: The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the bond is to changes in interest rates. Longer maturities may offer higher yields, but also greater price volatility if interest rates rise.\n3. Interest rate: This is the coupon rate paid by the bond. Generally, higher interest rates indicate better value for the investor.\n4. Market conditions: Bond prices fluctuate based on prevailing interest rates - when interest rates go up, existing bonds with lower interest rates become less valuable, causing their prices to fall. Conversely, falling interest rates cause bond prices to rise.\n\nAs for a recommended long-term bond ETF, some popular options include Vanguard Total Bond Market (BND), iShares Core US Aggregate Bond (AGG), and Schwab US Aggregate Bond (SCHZ). These funds hold a diversified mix of investment grade corporate and government bonds with varying maturities.",
        "answer_1": "High credit quality bonds dont have nearly as much donwside (potential loss in nominal value) than stocks, and at the same time provide a promised, 'fixed' coupon at a certain price. (hence the name fixed income investments). \nThe appeal of adding bonds to your portfolio is providing a (lower) relatively stable income that is not highly correlated with the gains generated from stocks (it can be for periods of time, like the 2010-2012 recovery bull-market for the US).  \nThe end result is that the overall portfolio has now achieved \na) a shorter downfall potential in the event of an overall market downturn and \nb) a higher risk-adjusted return, by reducing the correlations between assets and moving the portfolio closeer to being an \"efficient portofolio\" in the sense that it provides the highest return for each unit of risk assumed (traditional finance uses volatility as a proxy for this, not a perfect choice but that's a whole different topic)\nWhat makes a bond good/attracctive? In short, a bond is a credit promise, you want the highest yield, with the lowest level of risk, this is where credit analysis comes in. Bonds are by far the largest asset class when you consider the many types Gov't + Corporate bonds that exist, but in order to keep this short, you want high credit quality (ability to make timely promised payments in terms agreed) and higher yeild. \nNaturally this an inverse relationship in which bond traders (including computers using HFT) are looking for value by buying 'cheap' bonds, most commonly used metric would be the spread relative to its credit rating, which is a measure of credit quality given by he ratings agencies. The spread would be the distance in percentage bassis points that a particular bond you're looking into trades from their peers, so, assuming everything else is the same among the peer group, you're looking for the higher spread (highest yielding bond). The peer group is usually based on credit rating.  Note that the natural relationship is that the lower the rating, the higher the yeild. \nBonds are a whole particular universe and a larger chapter of finance. [It is definetely worth taking up a look, and this could be a good place to start to read about credit quality, credit ratings, interest rate risk and spreads.]( \nAs for ETFs, depending on the riskiness of bonds you seek for your portfolio, you could use a variety of things. Vanguard's BLV tracks the performance of the Barclays U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index. \nAdding bond exposure is also a good way to 'anchor' your portfolio or parking some cash, though keep in mind the main risks all bond face are interest rate risks, as their yields are worth less once the risk free rate rises, and hence they're expected to lose value once/when the FED raises rates. \nThe main thing you should take away from this is that it is almost always a good idea to add at least SOME bonds to your portoflio to anchor your portfolio, and improve its risk adjusted return by providing a steadier base and relatively lower, abut also steadier income than stocks. \nYou can find [tons of bond ETF that are long/short on different typees of bonds here](  It will mostly be a matter of how much to add to it, and what level of risk you want in your bonds. \nThe old adage (not very scientific butt provides a ballpark figure) is to have a portoflio mix of (100%- AGE%) in stocks and the rest in bonds, e.g if you're 30, that would be 70% stocks, 30% bonds. I hope this helps as a start. Good luck with your reading!",
        "answer_2": "Current teaching is to consider all income streams when calculating asset mix, ie, both your human and financial capital. If you work a job that pays a salary without much fluctuation, or in other words, acts like a fixed income investment, then you're safe to be 100% stocks. For example, if you're a 25 year old accountant who gets paid the same salary each year, that fixed income stream for the next 35 years discounted to present value is far larger than any sum of money you could invest today. So you are already 99% weighted to fixed income, so feel free to put it all in stocks. Its later down the road when you save up half a million dollars that the weights start to change.\nHowever if you work a job that has pay more correlated with the market, like an investment banker, you're better off putting a good chunk of money in bonds, because you already have equity capital market exposure in your salary/bonus pay.\nNote: This assumes a lot of things, not to be taken completely at face value, as each persons' finances are unique."

Average household income (median) in the US is around $68k/year. Assuming you started working at age 25, that would be about $2 million over your career so far. Subtract any student loans or other debts, and you should have a rough idea of where you stand.\n\n2. The typical advice is to aim for having 1x annual expenses saved by age 30, and 3x by age 40. So if your living costs are $50k/year, then you should have between $150k-$450k saved up. Again, this will vary based on factors like whether you own a home, how much you earn, etc.\n\n3. A common rule of thumb is to save 15% of your gross income each year for retirement. If you've been doing that since graduation, you could have around $225k in a 401(k)/IRA by now. Add that to your total net worth.\n\nRemember that these figures can vary widely depending on many factors - location, lifestyle choices, career path, etc. But hopefully they give you a ballpark idea of where you might fall.",

Hi all I just received some potentially life changing financial news and I wanted advice on how Reddit thinks I should proceed with it.\nTo add a little bit of context I\u2019m a 22 year old male. I just graduated college with a bachelor\u2019s degree this past year and am working my first job in my field making around $40k.\nThis past weekend my parents visited me and told me the news. Basically, when my uncle passed away (about 10 years ago) he left me his entire retirement account. We had a really close relationship and while I was young he felt that I deserved the money more than anyone else in his life. While I\u2019m not sure the exact amount it was at that time, it sits now at around $120k. From what I understand this is after being taxed.\nMy question is, how can I invest this money to get ahead in life? I know for someone my age this is a ridiculous amount of money and like I said really could be life changing. I don\u2019t feel the need to go out and splurge and buy a bunch of materialistic things I\u2019d much rather invest it for bigger things like a house/car in the future.\nMy parents have an investment advisor that they said they could refer me to but he takes 1% of your portfolio every year. I guess this isn\u2019t that much considering $120k isn\u2019t a ridiculous amount of money but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019d be worth it.\nWould now be a good time to enter the stock market? I know with the Coronavirus the market is dropping right now to extremes but a friend has told me this would be a good time to buy low in stocks. Or maybe I should just invest in mutual funds?\nMy company also does a 401k match program that I\u2019ll qualify for in a few months so I plan on doing that but should I also open an IRA or Roth IRA? I spoke briefly about it with my dad and he said since the money was already taxed this might not be the best idea (I don\u2019t quite understand that).\nBasically, I just have no clue where to go from here.

A 1% fee is pretty standard for an investment advisor, especially one recommended by your parents. You may want to shop around and compare fees, but that's a reasonable price.\nFourthly: Since the money is post-tax, you cannot contribute it to a traditional IRA - only pre-tax income goes into those. However, you CAN put it into a ROTH IRA, as long as your income is below certain limits ($139,000 for singles, $206,000 for married couples filing jointly). If your income is too high, then skip the ROTH and stick with a regular brokerage account.\nFinally: Resist the urge to spend frivolously.

        "prediction": "Always prioritize your retirement savings over a hypothetical future home purchase. The benefits of compounding returns from starting early are too great to pass up. If you have maxed out your 401(k), then yes, contribute to a Roth IRA. You can always save separately for a downpayment on a house.\n\nThe only time you would ever consider touching a Roth IRA before retirement is for a first-time homebuyer exemption, which allows you to withdraw up to $10,000 without penalty for a first-time homebuyer. But this shouldn't be a factor here since you say you won't buy a house for another 10-20 years.",
        "answer_1": "\nShould I start saving for a down payment for a house or squirreling it in a Roth IRA?\n\n10 to 20 years is a long time away and the tax laws may change. At the moment, however, you may withdraw up to $10,000 from your IRA for a down payment on a home. This is for \"first-time home buyers,\" which is a loose term that actually means \"anyone who has not owned a home in the last 2 years.\"\n[Source]( \n\nShould I even touch the Roth for anything other than retirement?\n\nA Roth IRA is an amazingly versatile savings vehicle. Because your contributions are post-tax, you can withdraw the entirety of your contributions at any time, without condition, tax-free. If you put $5,000 in your Roth IRA this month, you're free to pull out $5,000 next month without consequence.\nYou may not, however, pull out any earnings from your Roth IRA until you reach retirement age (59 1/2)^1. Still, it's a great deal: tax-free growth and the option to use the principal as an additional emergency fund. It should probably not be used as your main emergency fund, because your Roth investments are likely to be riskier than cash holdings.\n[Source]( \n\nIf not, how should I save for a large expense that's at least 10 years down the line but with no certainty as to when it will happen?\n\nIf you already have a 6 month emergency fund, I see no reason not to invest your \"downpayment\" into a Roth IRA. Especially because your career may increase your income down the line and make you ineligible for a Roth, it's good to open one early in your career. I get the impression you're starting out since you are uncertain if you'll be settling down or purchasing a property in the near future.\nI think Roth is the best option, but if you'd rather not, you could always look into [laddering CDs]( ^2 or high interest checking accounts.\nI have a 3% high interest checking account and just opened another 4% interest checking account. You have to meet certain requirements, such as a minimum number of debit transactions each month. Google \"high interest checking\" to search for an account you can apply to, either in your local city/state or online.\nBest of luck, hope that helps.\n1: Except certain special situations, such as the first-time home buyer situation, as stated explicitly by commenters below.\n2: Unfortunately, CD interest rates have dropped significantly since this article came out. Rates are hovering around 1% and change. The basic methodology is still sound, however.",

My point is, if the stock market in going to be up in 10-20 anyways, like it has historically , why would someone not invest in TQQQ and have way higher returns instead of buying the well-recommended QQQ? (expense feed dont matter, considering how much it outperforms the normal etf)\nJust a question to learn :) Thank you!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "While it's true that TQQQ (Nasdaq 100 Leveraged ETF) provides significantly higher returns than QQQ (Invesco QQQ Trust), there are several reasons why investing in TQQQ for the long term may not be a good idea:\n\n1. Volatility: TQQQ uses leverage to amplify returns, which also means it magnifies losses during downturns. The volatility can be extreme, making it unsuitable for most investors with long time horizons.\n\n2. Risk: Because of its high volatility, TQQQ carries more risk than QQQ. This increased risk could lead to larger losses over the long run, even if the overall trend is upward.\n\n3. Fees: While expense fees don't matter as much when comparing two highly similar products, they do matter when comparing an ETF with significant additional risks. TQQQ charges an annual fee of 95 basis points (bps), while QQQ charges only 20 bps. That difference alone eats into your potential gains.\n\n4. Rebalancing: With TQQQ, you need to rebalance frequently because of its leveraged nature. Failing to do so will result in large deviations from your intended asset allocation.\n\nOverall, while TQQQ might provide higher short-term returns, it's generally not recommended for long-term investment due to its excessive risk and costs. Stick with QQQ or other broadly diversified index funds for your long-term portfolio.",

Over the course of 10 years, a bear or sideways market is probable, which will crush your investment. \nI recommend testing the waters by holding no more than 5-10% of your total portfolio if you\u2019re interested. \nYou\u2019ll capture the upside and be better off than just holding QQQ, but you also won\u2019t get crushed if it loses 90% of its value (if it were your entire portfolio). \nThis is how I understand it. My analysis probably isn\u2019t perfectly correct, but this is basically why people don\u2019t hold for long term. ",

For the past year, my credit score has (according to CreditKarma, anyway) has been decreasing. I paid my truck loan early last fall, bought a motorcycle over the winter and paid it off last month, and paid off one credit card with a $1000 balance last month. \nI had another card that I opened when I was 18 that was tied to my first student checking account (26 now). It had a low limit that I never bothered to increase because I didn't care for the bank, a mediocre interest rate, and I only used it to pay my truck's sat radio subscription. I moved the sub to my other card for simplicity, and the next month the bank on the old car lowered my limit to $300 and then cancelled the card. My credit rating went down almost 25 points. \nI understand that cancelling that card was not good. I didn't ask them to do it, though. I was going to put stuff like gas on it every so often to keep it active. Now, I pay the balance on my Visa monthly, and no other debt. I want to buy a house in the next year, and at this rate, my credit will be in the mid 600's by the time that happens. \nI make 70k a year, full time job. No major debts, monthly bills are around $800/month. Saving money well, and adding to my 401k. \nWat do, PF? Thanks.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Your credit score is dropping due to a decrease in available credit. When they closed your old card, you lost some of your available credit which caused your utilization ratio to go up. This is the percentage of your total available credit that you are currently using. You should aim to keep this below 30%. Since you have no other debt besides your mortgage or rent payments, consider asking the bank to reinstate your old card or open a new one with a higher limit. Just remember to use it responsibly and pay it off each month.",
        "answer_1": "If you're planning to buy a house in a year, you should probably look into getting a real credit score and not rely on Credit Karma. Paying off open debt can decrease your score a little (this case it's almost certainly because it lowered average credit age by a good bit), but generally if you're continuing to use credit responsibly then your score should be in good shape for anything you'll need it for. The major factors that you can change in the short term are utilization (I'd say shoot for about 10-15%) and making sure you have all payments on-time to avoid negative marks.\nIf it's any comfort, I recently got my real FICO and it's almost 770. CK lists my score as 690-something. So you may well be fine, you're just seeing the limitations of CK's FAKO. ",
        "answer_2": "Paying off debt and closing the account will hurt your score because of the manner in which a FICO score is calculated. Available Credit is one of the variables. If you have a credit card with a $10,000.00 limit and it's charged up all the way, then you have zero available credit and that hurts you. If you have a $10,000.00 card with a zero balance, then you have $10,000.00 available credit, and that is a plus. \nSo if you want to keep your score high, when you pay off a credit card, leave it open. \nThis is crazy, but it's the way FICO works.

You can get a feel for where job openings currently are, what qualifications they\u2019re looking for, and what the general pay scale is.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nWhy is the Vanguard Retirement Nest Egg Calculator so different than FireCalc and others? I'm talking about this page here:  [  \nLong story short, Vanguard's calculator has surprisingly high failure rates for greater than 30 years for withdrawal percentages that have never historically failed. Like 7-8% failure rates at 40 or 50 years for a 3% withdrawal rate.\nThis leaves me wondering - why is this so different than calculators like FireCalc, which essentially show 100% perpetual success rates once you lower your withdrawal rate to around 3%?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The main difference between Vanguard's retirement nest egg calculator and other tools like FireCalc is in how they handle sequence of returns risk (SOR). SOR refers to the impact that poor market performance early on in retirement can have on long-term outcomes.\nVanguard's calculator takes into account SOR by using historical data to simulate potential outcomes based on various scenarios. This means it considers not just average annual returns but also the ups and downs of the markets over time. As a result, it shows higher failure rates during periods of low expected returns or high inflation.\nFireCalc, on the other hand, assumes a constant return each year, regardless of what actually happens in the stock market. While this simplification makes calculations easier, it doesn't accurately reflect the reality of investing.\nIn summary, Vanguard's calculator provides a more realistic view of the risks involved with retirement planning, while FireCalc may be too optimistic in some cases.",
        "answer_1": "So, I dug through Vanguard's code.  \nTheir simulation is driven by 90 years of historical actual returns data.  The actual config file used by the simulation is [here](   \nHere's a brief explanation of their code:  \nFor each year (do this N times, where N is the # years chosen):\n  - Pick a random year from the list of 90\n  - Increase/Decrease expenses by CPI for that year, set the new expenses value\n  - Withdraw the new expenses value from the balance\n  - Factor in returns (weighted by fund allocation) from that year, and update the new balance\n  - Repeat.\nThis appears to be a basic, functional, Monte Carlo simulation.   \nThe reason it has more failures is because it's possible to get multiple 1931s in a row (-43% stocks), or some other combination of bad years in a streak (1931, 1973, 1974, 2000, 2008).  They're not picking one starting year and moving forward, so there's no \"cyclical nature\" to their simulation.  Two of those catastrophic years in a row will sink almost any FIRE plan.",
        "answer_2": "All these calculations based on predefined withdrawal rates miss the point. No sensible person would set out intending to stick to their withdrawal rate regardless of the state of their retirement funds. At most, what these projections tell you is what withdrawal rate your assets will probably sustain, with varying levels of confidence."

I have about $1200 saved up and was wondering if anybody had any advice on how and where to invest it to make more money, or any ideas on how I could save money quicker and better:)\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As a 17-year-old with only $1200 in savings, investing is not the best idea right now. Your priority should be building an emergency fund - aim for saving three to six months' worth of expenses. Once you reach that goal, then you can consider investing.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some ways to save money faster:\n\n1. Create a budget and stick to it. This will help you understand your income and expenses so you can identify areas where you can cut back.\n\n2. Reduce unnecessary expenses. Look at things like subscriptions, eating out, and entertainment costs. Can you find cheaper alternatives?\n\n3. Cook meals at home instead of eating out. This can save you a lot of money over time.\n\n4. Use coupons and discounts when shopping. There are plenty of resources online for finding deals.\n\n5. Consider getting a side hustle. If you have free time outside of work, look into opportunities to earn extra cash.\n\nRemember, building wealth takes time and discipline. Focus on making smart financial decisions now, and the investment returns will come later.",
        "answer_1": "Since this is the first $1200 you have saved up, you probably don't want to invest it in the stock market. Instead, you want to use it as your emergency fund.\nYou describe yourself as a \"broke girl\", but you're not anymore! Broke people live paycheck to paycheck. They make money, and then spend it immediately. They're close to being broke again by the time they get their next paycheck.\nTake that $1200 and promise yourself that you will NEVER live paycheck to paycheck. Always have enough to be one paycheck ahead. And then make it two paychecks ahead. Eventually you want to get to the point where you are about 3 months ahead.\nOnce you have that 3 month buffer, you can start investing money (probably in a Roth IRA, using a target date fund or total market index funds). If you work for a company with a 401k, you'll want to contribute enough to get the full company match. But right now focus on building that buffer.\nThe reason for this buffer is that life is complicated. Unexpected things happen. Your car breaks down. Your pet gets sick. For someone who lives paycheck to paycheck, any unexpected bill is a disaster. But for you, it's not an disaster anymore! You just take your savings and pay off the unexpected bill. Think of your emergency fund as your superpower. You become stronger, tougher, and more resilient than people who live paycheck to paycheck. \nI'm not sure if you can open your own bank accounts at 17, but once you turn 18, you'll want to keep most of your emergency fund in a savings account that pays you around 2% interest or more. (Lots of online banks like Ally and Discover have good interest rates. But the megabanks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo will rip you off by paying you 0.1% interest or less).",

I'm a 21 year old female, living with my 22 year old girlfriend in a 2 BR at $900 a month. We originally had another couple living with us, but they turned out to be a nightmare and left 2 months into the lease. Right after they left I lost my job because of a minor injury (I had a box fall on my foot), I had 7 days to have a doctor sign a form or else I was considered a liability. None of the urgent care centers would sign and my Primary Care couldn't see me till 20 days after. I receive $733 a month from disability to pay for rent.\nMy S/O lost her job a month later due to the same shitty company practices and couldn't get anyone to sign either. This was her income too.

        "prediction": "Pros of Credit Unions:\n1. Not-for-profit organizations: Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives that exist to serve their members rather than make profits for shareholders. This can result in lower fees and higher interest rates on savings accounts.\n2. Member-owned: Members have an ownership stake in the credit union, which means they may be more invested in its success and receive better service as a result.\n3. Personalized Service: Credit unions often offer more personalized customer service due to smaller size and membership base.\n4. Community Focused: Many credit unions focus on serving specific communities or professions, such as teachers or firefighters, providing additional benefits and resources to those groups.\n5. Better Rates: Due to their non-profit status, credit unions may offer better loan rates and higher savings account yields compared to banks.\n\nCons of Credit Unions:\n1. Limited Availability: Credit unions typically have fewer branches and ATMs than large national banks, making it less convenient for some people.\n2. Field of Membership Restrictions: Some credit unions only accept members from certain geographic areas, employers, or affiliations, limiting who can join.\n3. Fewer Products: While larger banks offer a wide range of products and services, credit unions may have limited product offerings.\n4. Smaller Deposit Insurance: Federal deposit insurance through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) covers up to $250,000 per depositor at each credit union, but this is less than the coverage provided by the FDIC for most banks ($250,000 per depositor, per institution).\n\nPros of Banks:\n1. Wide Availability: Large national banks generally have many branches and ATMs, making them more convenient for customers.\n2. More Products: Banks tend to offer a wider variety of products and services, including investment options and international banking capabilities.\n3. Larger Deposit Insurance: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, giving customers greater protection against loss.\n4. Technology: Banks often invest heavily in technology, offering advanced online and mobile banking features.\n\nCons of Banks:\n1. For-Profit Motivation: Banks operate as for-profit businesses, meaning they prioritize profit over member/customer satisfaction.\n2. Higher Fees: In pursuit of profits, banks may charge higher fees for various services compared to credit unions.\n3. Less Personalization: Due to their size, banks may provide less personalized customer service compared to credit unions.\n4. Potential for Scandal: Because they're publicly traded companies, banks may face more scrutiny regarding scandals and mismanagement compared to credit unions.\n\nUltimately, whether you prefer a credit union or a bank will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If convenience, product selection, and technology matter most to you, then a bank might be the way to go. However, if you value not-for-profit principles, community focus, and potentially lower costs, then a credit union could be a better fit.",
        "answer_1": "You are an owner in the credit union.  You are not an owner in the bank.\nThe credit union keeps costs low so their products and services are often more limited.  Banks seek to serve a wider range of clients and build more sophisticated products and services to serve them.\nIt depends on what you're looking for and what options are available to you locally.\nThey both exist because they both have pros and cons.",
        "answer_2": "This is from my own very limited experience, comparing my wife's credit union and the major regional bank where I have my deposit account.\n\nMy bank has a much better online platform than her credit union.  The credit union actually uses a third party site just to offer PDFs of account statements.  My bank's site can initiate ACH transfers, pay bills online, and much more.  My wife's credit union cannot.\nHer credit union's loan offerings are much more limited.  Mortgages are capped at $350,000.  (That's an irrelevant restriction for us because in our location, that's enough for plenty of house, but it would be tough in San Francisco.)  In addition, they do not offer points on mortgages or many other forms of loan product flexibility.  But the rates are pretty reasonable and they don't charge origination fees (in fact, they even ponied up extra cash towards closing costs for our mortgage).\nHer credit union's depositor-service offerings are more limited, too.  They don't even offer an ATM card or credit card.  Getting direct deposit set up was easy enough, but the only way we've ever made an actual withdrawal has been by sending an email to an actual human being at the credit union to authorize the transfer, which was verified by a return phone call placed to us.  No online funds transfers, no actual branches where one can walk in and withdraw money, and like I said, no debit or credit cards.  I don't even think they offer checks.  We certainly don't have any.\nThe current dividend on shares (equivalent of interest) at the credit union is 0.75%.  At my bank, it's 0.25%.  Of course, both of those are lousy, that's just what interest rates are like right now.  But the combination of the fact that (a) it's easy to get money into the credit union (many people at the Fortune 500 company it's associated with simply have a portion of their paychecks automatically deposited there), (b) it's a little bit harder to access once it's there, and (c) it earns at least a little bit more interest while it's there, means that she and most of her coworkers use the credit union as a savings account or a place to put some money away little by little to build up for major purchases, while using a more traditional bank for everyday cash management needs.\nHer credit union largely ignored some black marks on her credit history when she applied for a loan.  We were denied for a mortgage loan by two local banks because of her credit.  I don't think her credit union even pulled her score.\nHer credit union approves loans with dramatically less paperwork than traditional banks.  As in, the total volume of forms for our mortgage was four pages.\nHer credit union is dramatically less leveraged than almost any bank I've heard of.  They release their figures monthly, in a newsletter that looks like the local high school newspaper editor did it in his spare time.  In September, they had about $170M in deposits (shares) and $30M in outstanding loans.  Bank executives would probably be on the verge of getting fired if they were so risk-averse.  Usually those numbers will be flipped and more in the commercial banking world.\n\nI'm sure that there are other credit unions that are nothing like my wife's company's, and I'm sure there are plenty of regular for-profit banks out there that have antiquated tech as well.  But those are the differences I've noticed.  And for the record, I'm pretty happy with both my bank and her credit union, and I'm glad that the overall financial landscape in this country is such that there's room for both."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nI just got a new car and had to put 95% of my savings down on it and also had to take on a really high APR So, I recently got my license and, shortly after, decided to go get a car. I went to my local Honda dealer looking for a car I had already found online. Once I found out it was there, I was pretty much already at the point of being sold on it. It was a Honda Civic 2016 LX with only 36,777 miles and no issues or past accidents for $13,677.\nI got with a representative and we started talking about my car credit. Well, I had absolutely no car credit, since this would be my first financed car, so the guy told me I would have to put a larger amount down on the car. I originally came in with the intention of only putting down $2,000 max out of my $3,580 in savings down on the car. So, when I said $1,500 and the guy asked if I could put $2,000 instead to increase my chances of getting a loan, I was a little discouraged but understanding since I had no credit and I really wanted this deal. The guy then walks to the back to give this information to the banks. After about 20 minutes, he comes back and asks if I could put down $2,500. I start getting a little annoyed at this point, but I agreed none the less. He walks to the back and I wait about another 20 minutes. The guy comes back and, this is when I get really freaked out, he says that the bank is willing to give me a loan, but I would have to put down $3,500. I sat there for a solid minute to think this one out, but I really wanted to get a car to start a new job I've been looking at for a while and I didn't want to die in a junker vehicle, so ultimately I decided to go for it. I was getting my paycheck in a few days anyways and I live with my father, so it didn't seem like too much of a risk. Once I'm signing papers, I end up getting to the part where I see my APR and loan term. This is where my bum is starting to feel a little sore. It was a 6 year loan with a 25% APR. And so now, I have a car that ended up being $25,000 instead of $13,677. \nWith my position right now, I feel like I can manage the payments, but what I'm asking here is: Is there a better way to handle this loan now with the circumstances? Should I try to get a co-signer to lower the APR and payments? If so, could I do it with my current loan, or should I refinance? If I do that, do I refinance now, or in two years? Are there other ways to clean up this mess?\nAny input would be appreciated here.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "That's an incredibly high interest rate. You were essentially charged a penalty for having no established credit history.\nYou need to work on improving your credit score as soon as possible. Paying the car off early will save you thousands in interest charges. Until then, don't take on any more debt, cut expenses wherever possible, and make those payments religiously. Refinancing may help, but until you improve your creditworthiness, you won't qualify for anything significantly better than what you currently have.",
        "answer_1": "Wow, you got swindled.\nYou'd have to refinance to get lower APR.\nI'd try to refi with a local credit union.  Ideally you'd try soon, as hopefully you don't owe more than the vehicle is worth.  On a 6-year note the concern is you're going to become upside-down in the car, and getting it refinanced then would be difficult/impossible without bringing additional cash to the table.",
        "answer_2": "You knew something was wrong after the multiple requests to put more down but went through with it anyway.  It's odd how car dealerships do this to people (my dad is a sucker at the car dealer however not this bad).  Personally I would sell the car.  You are talking about being able to afford the payments, but in reality you cannot afford the car.  24.99 percent on a car loan is unimaginable.  I make in the six figures and drive a car that cost <$5000.  In the last 3 years all it has needed was oil changes."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHow should I quit my job? Looking for some advice on this situation...\nI currently have two part time jobs.  One I got in October of last year - the other one I've had since April.  The job I've had since April is now offering me full time which comes with a hourly wage almost equal to the first job with a whole ton of awesome benefits as well.  So I definitely want to do that instead of continuing to work 60+ hours a week.\nIn the past I have always used the two-week notice as a professional courtesy.  This job that I want to quit now though - only giving a two-week notice would almost undoubtedly screw them.  I only have 4 other co-workers in my \"department\" and we are split among 3 zones and are all part-time with other jobs.  Zones in this context is just cities and towns in about a 50 mile radius.  One of these zones is solely my responsibility.  I work with clients in my zone who I meet with during my workday.  I have clients booked up with me throughout the next 3 months.\nTo do my job requires me to be certified by the state and involves at least a month of training alone and then some for paperwork, etc.  So me quitting would mean a scramble to hire someone else who would undoubtly need to be trained to get certified before they could even start to take over for me.  I think this could take my employer 2 months or more to do.\nBut I really don't want to keep working this job for all that to happen.  I don't really have any bad feelings for my employer; I'm just in a position to have something better right now.. That is just how it goes.  However, that being said; I'm offered absolutely no benefits from this employer and I believe I am being paid $2-$5/hr less than my co-workers (which would put them at or around $20/hr).  But even if they offered me a good bump in pay I still wouldn't see it as worth it compared to being full time at the other job and having a better work-life balance.\nIf I wasn't so worried about feeling guilty I would just give my two weeks, be done and not worry about leaving them high and dry.  But I'm typically not that type of person.  So I want to give my employer the option of keeping me a little bit longer and instead giving a 1-2 month notice or some sort of staggered leave where they could continually reduce my schedule over a set time period (like 3 months).\nHowever, if I gave them an option like that, I would kinda want them to make it \"worth my while.\"  I just wouldn't have any idea how to bring that up without sounding like an absolute scumbag.\nShould just skip all that and just give them a 2-3 week notice and leave them to figure their own shit out?  Or should I offer to stay longer if they work something out with me?  If so how should I go about brining that up?\nAnd just to be clear- I'm not trying to take advantage of a situation to pry money out of the employer... I would be just as happy if they had someone to replace me and I could just up and quit.\nSorry for the wall of text.\n<|assistant|>\n",

I\u2019m new-ish to the US and still learning such things.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "A Roth IRA is a specific type of account with tax benefits, while M1 Finance is an investment platform that allows you to invest your money in various ways. Here's how they differ:\n\n1. Tax treatment: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars (i.e., you don't get a deduction for them), but qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are completely tax-free. This makes it a powerful tool for retirement savings because you won't have to pay taxes on the growth or withdrawals later in life. M1 Finance does not provide any special tax treatment - all profits are subject to capital gains taxes when withdrawn.\n2. Eligibility restrictions: There are income limits for contributing to a Roth IRA ($140,000 for singles, $208,000 for married couples filing jointly). If you earn more than these amounts, you may not be able to contribute directly to a Roth IRA. M1 Finance has no eligibility requirements beyond meeting their minimum deposit requirement.\n3. Required Minimum Distributions: Once you reach age 72 (or 70\u00bd if you turned 70 before 2020), you must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRAs and most other types of retirement accounts. Roth IRAs do not require RMDs during your lifetime. M1 Finance does not impose RMDs at this time.\n4. Custodial fees: Many brokerages charge annual fees for holding certain types of assets within an IRA. M1 Finance charges a management fee based on the amount invested, which can vary depending on the portfolio selected. A Roth IRA held through a bank or brokerage will likely also have some sort of administrative fee, although many institutions waive these for low balances.\n5. Investment options: Both allow for a wide variety of investment choices, but a Roth IRA typically offers access to a larger selection of mutual funds and ETFs due to regulatory reasons. M1 Finance focuses primarily on exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual stocks.",

But how much more? That would depend on your inflation expectations, the volatility expectations of your portfolio, taxation, etc.\nYour costs and required annual income will also vary depending on where you live, your family composition, and your lifestyle choices. Many costs which often form a part of a compensation package for an employee (such as healthcare) will be payable by you directly.\nFinally, even a fairly diversified portfolio is subject to a range of risks, from market risk to a prolonged depression - your portfolio can simply fail to perform to historic expectations within the finite time-frame of your life on earth.\nThus, while realizing the equivalent of a median U.S. household income from investments is [definitely feasible](  the wisdom of relying on this as your only source of income during your productive years is dubious.

        "prediction": "Based on your numbers, you should maximize your Roth IRAs first (that's $18,000 total). After that, continue making your regular monthly payments towards the mortgage. The math says to prioritize retirement savings over paying down the mortgage early, especially since you already have an emergency fund. However, everyone's situation is different, so you may want to consider how strongly you feel about being completely debt-free versus continuing to invest for retirement. Ultimately, the best decision depends on which option makes you happier and less stressed.",
        "answer_1": "\nbut is there a psychological advantage to having a paid for house?\n\nYes there is, but there's also a major advantage to having tax-free retirement money. Your Roth IRA's have yearly contribution caps, so for each year you don't contribute to them--you lose the opportunity.",
        "answer_2": "According to many financial calculators and an interest rate of 7% over 10 years, the difference between the two choices is probably less than 25,000 dollars.  \nIn favor of the house--it's not just psychological, it's strategic.  With 100 percent equity, you have a massive financial weapon close at hand.  The median length of employment for a 25-34 year old is 3.2 years at the same job.  \nIn my life, all of my largest pay increases have come from lateral career moves.  If you have that house paid off, you have the ability to step out, take risks, and make huge leaps without danger.  "

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHow does 401k work once you retire? I know there's a lot of talk about what to do to prepare for retirement in terms of investing in a 401k and what to do and not to do before retirement, but what about once you retire? I don't see much talk about that.\nSo once you do reach that golden age to retire and have a shit load of money in your 401k account, how do things work from there. Is there some automatic withdraw system where each month you withdraw x amount from your 401k account to live off of? Do you keep withdrawing until you die like Social Security or is there some limit as to how long you keep withdrawing? Do you have any control over any of this stuff like how much you can withdraw each month and for how long?\nAny information, advice, and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, there is an automatic withdrawal system called Required Minimum Distributions (RMD) starting at age 72 (used to be 70\u00bd). This means you must begin taking distributions from traditional IRAs and most employer-sponsored retirement plans, including the 401(k), by April 1 of the year after you turn 72. The RMD is calculated based on your life expectancy and the balance in your accounts.\nYou also have some flexibility with regards to when and how much you take out prior to RMDs. Many people choose to continue making withdrawals similar to their pre-retirement paycheck schedule, while others may opt to take larger sums initially to cover expenses such as paying off debt or major purchases. It\u2019s generally recommended to create a distribution plan that balances income needs with tax efficiency.\nIn general, it\u2019s best to consult with a financial advisor regarding your specific situation.",
        "answer_1": "It works like any other investment account where you can sell the investments and withdraw the money into your bank account at any time (just pay income taxes on any traditional 401k assets withdrawn).\nHow long / how much you withdrew is totally dependent on the balance of your 401k. If you have only saved $100 in there then you can only withdraw $100. Or you can probably set up automatic withdrawals, or whatever else you want.\nThere are required minimum distributions with traditional 401ks, which requires once you are 70.5 years old you must withdraw a certain percentage of the balance in a given year, that percentage increasing every year. But you can always withdraw more than that amount, assuming you have the funds to do so.\nI think the 4% safe withdrawal rate is a pretty good strategy, where if you were invested 50% stocks 50% bonds you could theoretically withdraw 4% of the account balance every year (adjusting for inflation each year) for at least 30 years without running out of money.",
        "answer_2": "The rules for what you can do with a 401k in retirement depend on your company's plan.  Some will let you set up periodic withdrawals, some let you take out money at any random time and amount you want.  Others only let you take a single post-retirement withdrawal, of the entire balance (In which case, you should roll it into an IRA).  They can have fees for setting up periodic plans, or not, or have fees for every single withdrawal.  \nRolling into an IRA is common, because then you can shop around for one you like, rather than having to go with the rules your former employer set."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nWhy do I always see homes in retirement communities selling for incredibly cheap? What's the catch? I live in Washington state and I see multiple homes in retirement communities going for dirt cheap. I'm talking $35,000 for a one bedroom one bath. Just to compare, an equal home would go for at the very least $100,000. I feel like it'd be easy to keep a tenant in these even though it's probably a high turn over rate. Maybe i'm underestimating how much of a problem that would be? Anyone have experience investing in such properties?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "There are several reasons why you might see low prices:\n\n1. High maintenance costs - Retirement communities often provide services like meals, transportation, and housekeeping which can make them more expensive to operate than regular apartments or houses. The lower sale price may reflect this higher cost structure.\n\n2. Limited market - Not everyone wants to live in a retirement community, so there may not be as many potential buyers for these properties. This can lead to lower demand and therefore lower prices.\n\n3. Age restrictions - Many retirement communities require residents to be 55+ (or some other age limit). This limits the pool of potential tenants, making it harder to find renters who will meet the criteria.\n\n4. Stigma - There is sometimes a negative perception around living in a retirement community, especially if they are associated with assisted living facilities. Some people may avoid these properties because they don't want to be seen as \"old\" or because they prefer a different type of housing arrangement.\n\nAs for keeping tenants, it really depends on the specific property and its location within the community. If the community has good amenities and is located near shops, restaurants, and medical facilities, then it could still be attractive to younger renters. However, if the community is isolated or lacks modern features, then it may be difficult to find tenants who aren't retired themselves. You should also consider the potential for high turnover rates due to the aging population moving out or passing away.",
        "answer_1": "Retirement communities are basically fixed economies because of the barrier to entry (55+ age restriction). A lot of people buy the homes to rent them out but keep in mind the rental rates are also fixed because of the same barrier to entry. Do your research into what the rental market looks like in the same communities and calculate from there.",

An interesting question posed to me by my boss, if he were to sell the company.. how much would I need to be 'fine'. Fine to him means not having to work any more. So me, at 27, like $50,000 a year for 30 more years is $1.5 M. To say nothing of inflation or marriage or kids, or what ill want in 10 years vs what I want now, which is simply to be debt free ($40k haha).

I would still work, but it would be nice not to worry about money AS much. \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The amount you'd need depends on your annual expenses and the interest rate you can earn on your investments. If we assume an expense level of $50,000 per year (before taxes) and a conservative 3% return on investment, you'd need around $1.67 million in the bank to generate that income. However, this calculation assumes you won't touch the principal - so if you plan to withdraw more than just the interest each year, you'll need even more. And as you mentioned, there are many other factors to consider beyond just current wants/needs. It may be worth consulting with a financial advisor to help you better understand your options.",
        "answer_1": "Your question is the root of a concept known as the safe withdrawal rate (SWR). This is the rate at which you can draw from the interest on your assets without decreasing the principle. For many, a SWR is 4%, with a more conservative estimate being around 3%. As such, assets of $1.25M would support a 4% withdrawal rate of $50k for the first year, increasing with inflation. That last bit is important. There is an assumption that your assets will grow by at least 4% after inflation, meaning you can take out more than $50k after the first year, and so on, to keep up with inflation and keep your real spending power constant.\nThe last bit I wanted to say is about \"in the bank.\" These assets would need to be invested in a combination of stocks/bonds in order for the interest to be enough to support this kind of income. If you put it in a bank at 0.05% interest you will rapidly draw down the principle and go broke.",
        "answer_2": "The other thing you have to think about with this problem is change in expenses. \nYou can do stuff like buy a house with cash if you have a couple million come in, and lower your living expenses.

I was pretty shocked to be offered the position as these jobs are rather competitive where I live. \nThe interesting thing about this position is that you didn\u2019t actually need a degree, as the job description on the application didn\u2019t require one. They only asked for two years of experience, which education goes towards. \nI\u2019m super excited to be given the opportunity, but I\u2019m obviously not going to be working for free. \nThe job posting has the salary between 50-75k per year.

In Argentina's case, they had been printing a lot of money to try to stimulate the economy, which caused inflation and made the currency fall in value.

        "prediction": "No, your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) takes into account all sources of income except for traditional IRA contributions and losses from passive activities. It does NOT include deductible expenses like mortgage or property taxes.\nSince you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA once your MAGI exceeds $127K, you should consider other options such as contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k). If you are eligible for an employer-provided retirement plan at work, that would likely be the best option since it is pre-tax. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may make sense depending on your marginal tax rate.",
        "answer_1": "This isn't a big deal, and is easily correctable. \nYou will just need to request a recharacterizion of your 2013 contribution if you determine your AGI is over the roth contribution limit. In this way your IRA provider will distribute the contribution and the net earnings attributable to the contribution from the roth account and put them in a traditional IRA so that you can treat the previously made contribution as a traditional IRA contribution. you just want to make sure you complete this process before your tax filing deadline, and realize that you will owe taxes on any income attributable to your roth contribution between when you made the contribution and and when the recharacterization is processed.\nAs for your questions on AGI, mortgage interest and property tax deductions would not reduce your AGI. AGI is only reduced by above the line deductions which includes things like: self employment expenses, HSA or deductible retirement account contributions, moving expense, alimony, or student loan interest.\nCongrats on the bonus! This is a good problem to have.",
        "answer_2": "Could always open an Annuity, and contribute to that as well--seeing that it is also taxed-deferred with no income limits.\nAs far as your AGI I am aware that your ability to contribute phases out after 112,000, and stops at 127,000 as you previously mentioned. Anything above 112,000 basically becomes tax-deferred income once you take it out at retirement. Any previous earnings off of post-tax contributions can still be qualified tax-free withdrawals. "

        "prediction": "The first step is to open an account with a brokerage firm or robo advisor (such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Betterment, etc.). Then you should create a simple investment plan based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Start by maxing out any employer retirement plans such as a 401(k) if available. This will give you an immediate tax benefit and free money from your company in many cases.\n2. If you don't have access to a retirement plan at work, then contribute the maximum allowed ($6,000/year) to a traditional or Roth IRA. Again, this gives you an immediate tax break.\n3. After those steps, continue investing in low cost index funds. These are mutual funds or ETFs that track broad market indices like the S&P 500. They offer diversification and long term growth potential. Some popular options include VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market), BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market), and VTSAX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index).\n4.

I had a bachelor's and have 2 years part time unpaid relevant experience and 2 full time, paid summer internships with relevant lab experience.\nI looked up various threads / websites on how to negotiate. I went on Glassdoor and Payscale and looked up averages for that particular position for the company. The average was about $31k-33k.

I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way and I thought they were open to negotiation (which I originally asked the HR too before naming a number).\n5 hours later, received a call from HR letting me know that the boss has gone with another candidate and my offer has been rescinded.\nI feel so sad and defeated.

I see a lot of homes  in areas I would love to live in advertising rent to own situations.   It seems too easy to avoid the banks for a year or two while living in the house I'd end up buying.  Is it a good deal or just a scam?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Rent-to-own (RTO) can be a legitimate option under certain circumstances, but it is not always a good deal and there are many potential pitfalls that you should consider before signing on the dotted line:\n\n1. Higher price: RTO properties usually come with a higher purchase price than comparable traditional sales because the seller is offering financing. This means that even if your credit isn't great now, you may still pay more over time due to the increased cost.\n\n2. Longer timeline: The typical RTO agreement lasts between one and three years. During this time, you will be paying above-market rent as well as a portion of your principal and interest payments. If you back out of the contract during this period, you could lose everything you have paid so far.\n\n3. No standardization: There is no regulatory body governing RTO agreements, which means that terms can vary widely from one property to another. Some contracts might require large balloon payments at the end of the term, while others might include hidden fees or penalties. Be sure to read the fine print carefully.\n\n4. Credit score requirements: While RTO agreements are marketed as an alternative to traditional bank loans, they often still require a minimum credit score or income level. If your financial situation has improved significantly since you first saw the ad, you may want to explore other options instead.\n\n5. Market risk: Finally, remember that real estate values can go down as well as up. If you sign a RTO agreement when prices are high, you could find yourself owing more than the property is worth by the time you actually buy it.\n\nIn short, RTO arrangements can make sense in very specific circumstances - such as when someone needs to improve their credit score or cannot qualify for a mortgage - but they should never be seen as an easy way to \"avoid\" working with a bank. Always consult with a trusted real estate agent or financial advisor before making any decisions about RTO properties.",

Did some research, using a lot of your credit isn't the problem, its using a lot of it then having it on your monthly statement. So even though you have an amount to time to pay it off before it gets interest, don't have more than 50-75 (I say that for your 500 limit specifically and made it on the safe side) dollars on your statement when it comes. I got a cash rewards card with not a lot of restrictions on redemptions and I have been buying EVERYTHING with it. Because I do this for every 50 dollars I spend, I make a payment. So if I go a few days and spend it on nothing but fast food, I wait till the balance hits 50 and send in an online payment. If I buy something online like a nice new widget from newegg for over 50, I pay that off as soon as it shows up on the card. Right now I made a big order from newegg so there's around 300 on it. That's ok because my statement isn't till the 22nd. The benefits are only if you A) have a good rewards card that won't make you jump through hoops for cash. B) you want to increase your credit limit faster. Using it a lot and then paying it off fast will show your reliable and you could need a higher credit limit. Why do you want a higher credit limit?

There's nothing wrong with living with my parents, I just wanted to move out to experience living with friends.\n\nIf this is genuinely true, and you're not going into extra unnecessary student debt to afford living on your own, then I would stay living with friends. I moved back in with my parents after college and honestly it was difficult. We get along great but the relationship just feels different once you have lived on your own and trying to figure that out can be challenging. It also can definitely have a negative effect on your social life as a student--this isn't financial but I think it's worth considering nonetheless. The people I rented a house with during my junior and senior years of college are some of the only people I have kept in touch with from that period of my life and living with them taught me a whole lot about life. Even just basic things like dealing with the cable company when the internet goes out, interactions with your landlord, figuring out how to navigate shared spaces with people who aren't just the family you've been with your whole life are all critical skills you'll have to learn at some point. College is a better time to do that than when you're in your first job working long hours and stressed. If you can afford to live outside your parents' house, I think the experience is worth it, but if you're paying rent with student loans you're likely better off moving home.\nThe majority of people on here will tell you to move back home because in pure financial terms, it's the more economical choice. But one thing that this sub is sometimes guilty of is forgetting that your finances aren't the only part of your life. Again, this assumes that you can afford this and aren't going into debt to live on your own, but consider what you want out of your college experience and what memories you're going to look back on.

The numbers no longer work: Maybe expenses have gone up (property taxes, insurance, maintenance), or rent hasn't kept pace with market rates. Whatever the reason, the return on investment may not be as high as it once was.\n4. They found a better opportunity: An investor might stumble upon another property that offers a better return on investment, so they decide to sell the current one in order to free up capital.\n5.

Or there's been a downturn in the local economy, leading to decreased demand for rental units.\n6. Personal preference: Some people just don't like being landlords anymore. It could be because of difficult tenants, unexpected repair bills, or simply a desire to pursue other investments.",
        "answer_1": "Investing in teal estate is not much different than investing in the stock market. \nWhen thinking about stocks consider that companies can underperform and even go out of business. No stock is risk free. You may buy a stock that has great long term potential as a buy and hold. You may buy other stocks that are in emerging markets and have higher risk.\nThe same connections can be made with real estate. Some properties are great for buy and hold. You may want to keep them indefinitely. They have low risk and a high upside.\nOther properties may he in fluctuating markets. The risk may be higher. You may have stagnant populations and job markets.\nThe other reason is to free up capital and lock in returns. You do not have a real return on investment until you have sold that investment. At the sell the return becomes real and the cash can be invested again.\nYou really do not want to own paid off properties. Part of the leverage on returns is having a payment being made by a tenant. If a tenant is essentially paying your loan payment then you are maximizing the leverage. \nFor example\nYou buy a $100k property for $20k down. Your tenant is paying the loan on the borrowed $80k and you are still getting a profitable return. When that loan is payed off then you are making a return on what may be a $200k property and $200k of your cash instead of $20k of your cash. That is not a great investment especially if the lease payment has not gone up by over 1000% in that time frame.\nWhat you can do is sell the property for $200k and reinvest that $200k return into five more properties worth $200k each with a $40k down payment. You now have $1 mill in properties purchased with $200k and lease payments that are paying down the loans. \nYour tenants can now pay down the loans on those properties until you sell and take real returns. Those real returns can once again be reinvested. ",

So a lot has to do with expectations of return.\nAlso, maybe this investor needs to sell to pay off another asset, or obligation. You never know at first, which is why the story behind the asset is so important.\nFinally, sometimes sellers aren't sophisticated. Maybe they're not managing the property well because they don't know the market well, what rents are, etc. Or maybe there's a good reason to fix up the asset but they just can't see it.

In fact, many successful traders recommend starting small and gradually increasing position size as confidence and experience grow.\n\nThere is no magical \"psychological barrier\" that needs to be broken - it's about consistently making good decisions over time, managing risk appropriately, and letting compounding work its magic. It takes discipline, patience, and a willingness to learn from mistakes.\n\nAs for your specific question about moving from $2500 to $10k+ trades... That's a big jump, and one that should only be made when you have a solid understanding of the markets, risk management, and yourself as a trader. If you're comfortable with $2500 losses, then you need to ask yourself whether you would still be comfortable with $10k losses. The principles of sound trading don't change regardless of trade size, so make sure you have a solid plan in place before taking on more risk.",
        "answer_1": "As a retail trader, the general rule is that you should risk 2% of your account on each trade. Note, 2% is how much you are willing to lose on each trade, not the total size of the trade.\nBack calculating, this means that you should have a trading account with $125,000 in order to be risking $2,500 per trade. \nThis means that if you have a trading account closer to say, $5,000, then you should only be risking $100 per trade.",

But as a general rule, I would suggest saving up a significant down payment (at least 20%) and making sure you understand all the associated costs of owning land and building a cabin, such as property taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc. It may also be worth consulting with a financial advisor to ensure this aligns with your long-term goals.",

I ran some numbers based on actual NASDAQ data to confirm. \nFor example... \nIf I invested $100 on 2/5/71 in QQQ I'd have $9,275 today. If I invested that in TQQQ I'd have $291,178.

        "prediction": "Leveraged ETFs are not meant for buy-and-hold strategies. They are designed for short-term trading, as their returns compound rapidly both ways: gains and losses. Holding them over extended periods can lead to large negative returns due to the effects of leverage and compounding. In your first example, while you made a lot of money by holding TQQQ during a bull run, imagine what would happen if you held it through the financial crisis or any other major downturn. The volatility and risk involved with these products is much higher than traditional index funds or ETFs. As the saying goes, \"past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"",
        "answer_1": "Leverage increases sequence risks. So the \"I can't retire, stock market is down\" problem becomes much greater.\nThe only valid use of leveraged funds I've seen is somebody proposed taking a 60:40 fund and using leverage to bring the expected return back to the level of a 100:0 fund. That gives you much more stable returns.",
        "answer_2": "In very short, the leverage amplifies the losses too, not just the gains. Since these structured funds have to renew their future contracts all the time (most daily, monthly is the rare max), they realize losses frequently. It's not just a big drawdown that makes these funds lose, but volatility can eat the capital pretty fast.\nAll that said, a leveraged ETF will work well for you if the asset it tracks moves in the desired direction with low volatility during the time interval in question. The longer this interval, the more likely one of the two conditions won't be met (direction and low volatility).\nSee also [Investopedia]( "

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHow bad do I look on paper? I recently pulled my credit score on creditkarma.com, and it came up at 678.  I am in my mid-twenties, and I have $24500 in debt: $8500 on a credit card (I've been a young idiot, I know), and $16000 in student loans (and I have already gone through a consolidation).  I have recently committed to paying $300 (just less than double the minimum payment) towards my credit card every month (and I no longer use it at all), and I pay $200 towards my student loans every month (which currently sits at a $0 balance, with no payment \"due\" until 2019 because I am so far paid ahead).  I am very committed to paying down all my debt over the next several years, and I am in a good position (with no account for additional income: raises, bonuses, etc.) to do so.\nBased on creditkarma, my credit utilization is at \"D\" (the limit is $9000, and until recently I relied heavily upon the card as a \"back-up\", which I now realize will kill me in the long term if I can't pay off the balance in full each month, and I am determined to get rid of it), my payment history is \"A\" (I have never missed a payment on any debt), my age of credit history is \"F\" (only 1 year and 9 months, although I have had my credit card since 2009?), total accounts is \"B\" (19 total, 15 closed, 4 open - 1 credit card, 3 student loans), credit inquiries \"B\" (1 hard inquiry), and derogatory remarks \"A\" (none).  My overall grade is a \"C\".\nSo, back to my question.  How bad do I look on paper?  I am applying for apartments with my boyfriend and I would hate to be the reason we are rejected.  Also, am I going about repayment in the right way?  At the end of the year, my intent is to spend my (anticipated) bonus paying down my smallest student loan in full, and putting the rest towards my credit card debt (as it has the higher interest rate).  Any additional income, I shoot towards my debt, and while I have a very small savings account, I know that saving is not beneficial while I still have these debts to pay off, with interest accumulating.  \nAny advice?  I'm trying to be less of a financial burden to myself, and my SO.  Thanks.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Your credit score is low due to high credit card balances relative to your limits. Paying more than the minimum should help improve your score, but you need to focus on bringing those balances down. You also need to stop treating your credit card like an emergency fund or backup plan; only charge what you can afford to pay in full each month.\nAs for how you look on paper, it's not great, but it could be worse. Your payment history is strong, and you don't have any major negatives. However, landlords may still prefer tenants without significant debt burdens, especially when they're sharing housing with someone else. It might be worth discussing this with your partner and seeing if there's anything you both can do to improve your finances before moving.",
        "answer_1": "Your credit card debt likely carries a much higher interest rate than your student loans - you should stop paying your student loans and put everything towards your credit card debt, especially if no payments are due until 2019.   In almost every case you should pay down debts starting with that which carries the highest interest rate.\n\nAny additional income, I shoot towards my debt, and while I have a very small savings account, I know that saving is not beneficial while I still have these debts to pay off, with interest accumulating.\n\nNot true.  Having an emergency fund of 4-8 months of expenses can cover you if you suddenly lost your source of income.",
        "answer_2": "Assuming the interest rate on your student loans is less than the interest rate on the credit card, I wouldn't pay anything towards the student loans if you don't have to right now.  Put all your money every month into getting rid of that credit card balance as quickly as possible, including using your bonus at the end of the year.  This will save you the most money, get you out of debt the fastest, and will lilely also happen to have the most beneficial immediate impact on your credit score as you more quickly reduce your revolving credit utilization.

She handed my coworker a copy of The Business of the 21st Century by Robert Kiyosaki to read, and they scheduled a coffee date. They met up again last night and my coworker had more questions like 'how do you make money', 'do you actually have the money you've made in your bank account', and flat out 'is this a pyramid scheme'. The woman said that she has the money in her bank account and it's not a pyramid scheme. The woman then told her what they did (or at used it as an analogy, she wasn't clear so my coworker was confused). Apparently Amazon goes to schools and tells them that if they get their students to order off of Amazon, Amazon will kick back 8% of the revenue to schools (which sounds like regular sales tactics but whatever). This woman's company tries to prevent that, and somehow they make a ton of money from it? The company's name is Bounce (not sure on spelling).\nThe way my coworker got approached makes it sound like a MLM scheme, but since they don't sell any products it sounds like a Ponzi scheme. What do you guys think? Has anyone seen this one before?\nAlso, my coworkers knows something weird is up and knows not to sign anything or give away any money, but we're both curious and so she's going to a training event next week sometime.

Over-the-top claims of wealth and success - People in MLMs often exaggerate how easy it is to make money, and how quickly they became wealthy.\n\n3. Pressure to attend events - Many MLMs use high-pressure sales techniques to try to convince people to join. Be wary of any pressure to attend events or meetings.\n\n4. Lack of transparency - If someone can't provide concrete evidence of their earnings, or won't let you see their actual bank statements, it's probably a bad sign.\n\n5. Use of buzzwords and jargon - Terms like \"networking opportunity,\" \"passive income,\" and \"financial freedom\" are common in MLMs, but shouldn't be taken at face value.\n\nYour coworker should approach this with skepticism and caution. Some good questions to ask include:\n\n1. How exactly does your company prevent schools from using Amazon's program? Is there any proof that this works better than Amazon's program?\n\n2. Can I speak to some current clients/customers of your company?\n\n3. Do you have any financial reports or documentation that show the success of your company?\n\n4.

They have you read a famous piece of literature or supply a motivational quote, tell you how they've made SO MUCH MONEY, and that they can retire whenever they like, but don't give you any clear cut information as to what the job actually entails.

I am sure they are nice people but they are not exactly Pearson.\n\"Justifies\" MLM is the massive red flag; why hasn't your friend even done one minutes research?\nDO NOT LET HER GO TO THE MEETING. It will have loads of happy people signing up to the scheme but I bet they are all part of the scam to pull in a few \"lucky\" people who have been invited.

Here are a few points you may want to consider:\n\n1. Sharing Bills: It sounds like you already have this covered. Make sure that both of you know what bills need to be paid and when they're due. You can still do this without combining your accounts.\n\n2. Identity Theft Protection: While having separate accounts won't completely eliminate the risk of identity theft, it does limit the damage in case something happens. If only one person's account is compromised, then the other person's money will remain safe. This can also help prevent misunderstandings or accusations about who spent how much where.\n\n3. Financial Independence: Some people prefer to keep their financial lives separate as a way to maintain independence and autonomy. Maybe one partner earns significantly more than the other, or has debt from before the relationship started. By keeping things separate, there's less potential for resentment or arguments down the line.\n\n4. Tax Implications: Combining income can sometimes result in higher taxes, especially if one spouse makes significantly more than the other. Keeping separate accounts allows each person to take advantage of their own tax brackets.\n\n5. Personal Preference: Ultimately, everyone's situation is different. What works for one couple might not work for another. Only you two can decide whether joining accounts is right for you.",

Dad's recently in nursing home, only makes money from social security, and has a ton of unpaid debt that he can't afford to pay from being careless with personal loans. I may end up becoming his power of attorney. What kind of liability do I have? Is there any risk of losing the car, or any risk any of this may affect my credit? \nlong version: My dad has a lot of various debts from being extremely careless with taking out loans. Now he's in a nursing home, and those debts may end up going to collections as he can no longer pay. He's lucky enough that one collections agency sent a letter stating some debt had been discharged (which honestly seemed random and out of place, that particular one was only 4 years old) but I'm sure he has plenty more debts ready to pop up. \nI did research and found that they can't touch his home/land, and he doesn't have any real assets. The only thing is the car. We both own 50% of the car, and it still has 4 years left to be paid off. Car payments aren't an issue, I've been paying and never have missed a payment. It's really my car, he just co-signed the loan for me. \nFrom what I read it seems like they could technically take his half of it and buy out my half or something to that extent? Assuming of course they go as far as to take him to court and win. I'm not entirely sure how it works....\nHis only income is social security/disability, and has been for years.\nAlso, with me possibly becoming power of attorney, what kind of debt liability does that give me? I may just end up being healthcare surrogate, but he'll probably end up needing me to be full PoA to manage his money at some point. \nHis credit at this point doesn't really matter, we're just focused on his health.

I then do my due diligence on  the properties which includes CMA and searching my county clerk's website for any outstanding liens. \nThere are plenty of risks. When you buy at auction you have to pay cash (cashier's check on the spot). You are buying a property sight unseen without any sort of seller's disclosure. The home could be (and usually is) occupied. Once you have purchased the home you need to find a way to enter the home if vacant or get the occupants out if occupied (cash for keys or eviction). Sometimes the information that you have on the house is incorrect  (eg- the home only has 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom when you thought it was a 3/2).\nThere are many risks purchasing at auction so you need to make sure that you buy the home at a sufficient discount in order to not get burned when the unexpected arises.\nBuying foreclosed homes that are bank owned is much easier. You can often use financing and you get to actually go inside the property during the showing. There is still no sellers disclosure when purchasing REO properties.",
        "answer_2": "Lots of good info in this thread. But for other novice would-be buyers I want to make a couple points. \nFirst, there are 3 types of value. Auction or liquidation value (lowest), market value (what we think of typical real estate transactions), and insurance value (highest value). \nLenders (GSE anyway, hard money lenders may be an exception but rates are steep) have minimum property requirements and standards and will not loan on houses that do not meet these. Many REO and auction properties either do not meet these or they are a risk for GSE lenders because they have not been inspected or appraised. They sell cheap because the only buyers are those with plenty of cash (although as has been mentioned, there are often cash buyers competing for these). \nIf someone needs a loan, they will be buying at market value, not auction or liquidation value. It is possible to buy a fixer upper at the low end of the market, such as if you do a 203K rehab loan, and put in some improvements and sweat equity to add value. But in general, the big discounts are going to cash buyers and they get a discount because of the risk and unknowns, and also because the only market is other cash buyers. \nBuying auction/liquidation is a very specialized and risky thing and no first time home buyer should even attempt this.

Read a ton go to investor meetings listen to podcasts all that good stuff. I'd talk to a lender and figure out what you need to qualify for an owner occupied loan youll need an income and tax returns getting a co signer will help but the bank needs to know you can keep the payments up. You can start with under 20k of course this is market dependent but for this particular strategy its more than enough. Wholesaling is another route i'm exploring but there is a lot of gurus and BS artists in that game so caution is key.

Here are some reasons why:\n\n1. Avoiding debt: If you have a history of overspending or struggling with debt, then avoiding CCs can help prevent falling into that trap again. Debit cards, on the other hand, draw directly from your checking account, which means you can only spend what you already have.\n\n2. Simplifying finances: With fewer accounts to manage, it may be easier to keep track of your spending and budget. You won't have to worry about interest rates, late fees, or annual fees associated with CCs.\n\n3. Building good habits: By using a debit card instead of a CC, you'll learn to stick to your budget and avoid unnecessary expenses. This can help build better money management skills over time.\n\nThat being said, there are also some potential downsides to going CC-free:\n\n1. Limited rewards: Many CCs offer cash back, points, or other perks for everyday purchases. Without a CC, you might miss out on these benefits.\n\n2. Lack of emergency funds: CCs can provide a safety net in case of unexpected expenses, like car repairs or medical bills. Without this backup, you'd need to rely on savings or borrowing from elsewhere.\n\n3. Fewer protections: CCs often come with fraud protection and purchase guarantees that aren't available with debit cards. Without a CC, you could be more vulnerable to scams or chargebacks.\n\nUltimately, whether or not to use CCs is a personal decision based on your individual circumstances and priorities.",

So, my first big question is does anyone know if this will actually help my credit, or if I would have better results by just waiting a year and a half for it to fall off and never touch it again? \nMy other concern if I do decide to take the settlement is that, since this is through a private collection agency, somehow the info will never properly get communicated back to Sallie Mae (well, Navient now). I assume as long as I keep the offer, a copy of the check I pay it with, and other documentation I can quickly shut down any future agency that tries to collect on it as well, but I'd rather not have to deal with that hassle forever. Is there any other good way to make sure this really ends forever with my payment?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Settling your debts for less than you owe may improve your credit score over having a defaulted debt. But settling also means you acknowledge that you owe less than you did, which could come back to haunt you later if you try to refinance or buy a house. If you wait until it falls off, then it will simply be reported as a charged-off debt, which isn't great either, but at least you won't be acknowledging that you only paid a portion of what you owed.\nAs for making sure it's settled: Get everything in writing, including a statement that says the balance is fully satisfied and that they will provide you with proof of satisfaction. Keep copies of all correspondence and payments made. And consider consulting with a consumer protection attorney to ensure that you're protected.",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the industry, and while I am not an expert by any means, I think I can help point you in the right direction (take it all with a grain of salt though).\nIf this is a federal loan, then you cannot discharge via bankruptcy, and they don't even need to sue you to start garnishment (kind of like the IRS).  There is also no SOL, and you should try to take care of this as soon as possible.\nGetting passed around to different collection agencies is not good, and a typical indicator of more drastic measures being taken in the near future.  You should also ask them to verify the debt to ensure you are paying the right loan with the right agency.\nThe default status is what is killing your credit report, and it will not go away until 7 years after the account is \"closed\" either via charge off or settlement.  They do seem to be willing to be reasonable, so I am sure you can get them to agree to report this as settled on your credit, which should help you out (especially if this is your only bad account).  I have seen people bounce back from chapter 7 bankruptcy in just over a year, so you should be able to do the same if you are careful.\nYou should not have a problem with them reporting the settlement to the loan servicer.  They will not get paid until the loan servicer pays them, so they are highly motivated to report correctly.  You can always ask them to put into writing anything you are not certain of, please do not just trust them to do something without talking to them about it.  This is more for documentation purposes, in case you have any additional issues come up with the account (especially with the credit agencies or a new lender).  Also request a final letter once the settlement has been paid.  They probably already do this, but it should be mentioned just in case.",
        "answer_2": "\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years.\n\nCredit reporting is always based on the date of first delinquency, no matter whether you pay the account or not. If you pay it, it will still fall off 1.5 years from now.\nDo your research on the collection agency, too. Find out what tactics other people have used."

The key difference was that I maintained the same standard of living while my income increased, which made me FI in my early 40s.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nIRS 401k Non-Discrimination Test How do you guys deal with the 401k non-discrimination test? \nI received an email from my company stating that those who make more than >120k are considered highly compensated individuals and therefore are capped at 10% before-tax contribution - meaning if you make <180k, you would never be able to contribute to the IRS limits of 18,000/year. \nI haven't really looked into the actual law that closely but it really irks me that I won't be able to contribute the max $18,000 in 2018 (thankfully, I didn't meet the limit in 2016, so I'll be okay for 2017). It's frustrating because my income is already taxed 40% and being able to max out my 401k and my HSA is one of the only ways I'm able to reduce my taxable income. I don't really understand why these limits exist when people with higher income also get taxed at higher rates already...\nFurthermore, when we take money out of our 401ks it still gets taxed anyway. :\\\nRant aside - what do you guys do to compensate for this? And who do I have to write a strongly worded letter to help get this repealed? \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "The reason for these rules is to prevent high earners from dominating the retirement plan benefits at the expense of lower earners. If everyone making over $120K could put away the maximum allowance, then the people making less wouldn't stand much of a chance. The idea behind these tests is to ensure that there's enough left over for the other employees as well.\nUnfortunately, your options here are limited:\n\n1) You can ask your employer to consider offering a profit sharing or other type of retirement plan that isn't subject to these nondiscrimination tests. This is unlikely unless your company has very few employees.\n2) You can live with the fact that you're not eligible to maximize your contributions and focus on saving outside of the 401(k), such as in a traditional or Roth IRA, health savings account, or taxable brokerage account.\n3) You can accept that you've hit the limit imposed by the nondiscrimination testing and move on.\n\nAs for writing a strongly worded letter, that's probably not going to accomplish anything. These laws were enacted by Congress, not your employer. Your best bet is to work within the system rather than trying to change it.",
        "answer_1": "You can talk to your company about offering a \"Safe Harbor\" match in the 401k.  If the plan meets the criteria for Safe Harbor, the discrimination test doesn't apply and you can put in the full $18k.   Or you could help the company increase participation by lower paid workers, so maybe the company can pass the test.\nOr you can change jobs to a company that does have Safe Harbor match.\nIn any case, you are much more likely to make a useful change if you try something locally, like changing your employer (or changing your employer, ha).  If you really want to waste time with a stern letter demanding changed legislation, start with your state Senators or district Representative.\nI put up with this one year at a company that promised they would change.  They added a match and all was well.  At another company, when the 401k becomes an employee anti-retention plan because of bad policies, the top talent leaves to find a better employer.  Do what you need to do.",
        "answer_2": "I wonder what the implications for this are if you're also doing the Mega Backdoor Roth (After tax 401(k) -> Roth IRA) contributions while simultaneously contributing 18,000 pre-tax. In the event you receive money back from your plan, which contribution type takes precedent? I imagine it would possibly come from both types if you contribute far too much relative to others in your plan. Regardless, this could cause real headaches for people."

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHIRING MANAGERS: Are company 401k policies usually negotiable? I move employers a lot. I tend to get bored after a couple of years and look for a new challenge. This has served me well as I usually get a nice little raise every time I move. Every company I've gone with has had a policy that 401k can't be contributed to until you're there for 6 months. At that rate I'm unable to contribute almost 1/4 of the time. I plan to retire early so and recently realized this is hurting me.. a lot.\nI always negotiate salary and it usually works out. I've never tried to negotiate 401k policies though and I think it may be something I should try. Would a company ever remove that 6 month restriction during negotiations? At least meet half way and allow immediate contributions but no matching until 6 months?\nI'd love to hear from someone in an HR/Finance department to clarify if things like this are usually negotiable within an org.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As an HR professional, I can tell you that vesting periods (including waiting periods before being eligible to participate) are generally not negotiable. The reason for this is that these policies have been put in place by the organization's leadership team and legal counsel to ensure compliance with various laws and regulations governing retirement plans. However, some companies do offer exceptions or accommodations on a case-by-case basis, particularly for highly sought-after candidates. In your situation, since you're moving frequently, it might be worth explaining your long-term financial goals and how contributing immediately would help you achieve them. But ultimately, there's no guarantee that any employer will make an exception just because you ask.",
        "answer_1": "No. Company 401k policies are NOT NEGOTIABLE.  The company is required by law to have the same policies for all employees in the group.  Some very large employers have multiple groups, with multiple 401k plans with different rules, but these are rare exceptions and even then they are required to put employees into the appropriate plan by some definitive rules, such as subsidiary A employees into plan A and subsidiary plan B employees into plan B.\nMany legal restrictions exist to prevent employers from favoring select employees, such as highly paid workers or management.  This also means that they are legally restricted from waiving rules like waiting periods, vesting or modifying matching for select favored employees.  You will NOT be able to negotiate different 401k rules for a single employee.\nThere are no legal restrictions on vacation policy, time off, work from home rules, benefits such as health care and so on.  Some companies (usually smaller ones) do allow negotiating benefit packages and employee/employer costs for benefits.  You can also negotiate sign-on bonus and severance agreements.  But you are legally not entitled to different 401k treatment from all other employees.  Attempting to negotiate 401k rules is a waste of time.",
        "answer_2": "Not exactly what you asked but just an fyi, there are legal restrictions on matching so that part isn't something you're likely to be able to change.\nBut you can still max it for the year even if you can only contribute a few months of that year."

I finished school and have a great career now that can support everybody, however I want my sis to be prepared and financially educated before she goes into the real world.\nI felt it is important to teach my little sis the power of saving and investing early in life, and I guess she's been listening.

I don't really feel it'd be wrong either way though, as I'm supposed to give cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7).  I should give as much as I can, with the fact in mind that 10% is what was required when the law (OT) was not perfect.

This is entirely speculative but I'm interested in who believes its a hoax, and who believes it will change the world.\nDiscuss?\nEDIT: By hoax I meant fad. Not a joke!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "I don't believe in \"hoax\" or \"fads\". However, here's my take on the future of 3d printing:\n\nthe current state of consumer-grade 3d printers is still very much an early adopter phase. The technology has come a long way since the first crude machines, but there's still a lot of room for improvement in terms of speed, reliability, and cost. That being said, industrial applications of additive manufacturing (which is what most people mean by \"3d printing\") are already transforming various industries like healthcare, aerospace, and automotive. These use cases require higher precision, materials science expertise, and regulatory compliance that go beyond the capabilities of hobbyist-level machines.\n\nin the short term (next few years), we can expect continued innovation in materials, software, and hardware to make desktop 3d printers more accessible and user-friendly. Some companies are also exploring new business models such as print-on-demand services and distributed manufacturing networks.\n\nover the longer term (decade+), i see two possible scenarios:\n\nscenario 1 - mainstream adoption: if the costs and limitations of 3d printing continue to improve at a rapid pace, then we could see widespread adoption in areas like architecture, construction, fashion, and education. This would create significant disruption in traditional supply chains and lead to new opportunities for startups and established players alike.\n\nscenario 2 - niche market: if the technology hits a plateau or faces major challenges like intellectual property infringement, safety concerns, or environmental impact, then 3d printing may remain a niche market serving specific niches like prototyping, customization, and repair.\n\nit's important to remember that every disruptive technology goes through cycles of hype and skepticism before reaching maturity. So while some investors might be getting spooked now, I think this is actually a good time to evaluate the fundamentals of each company and decide whether you want to bet on the future of 3d printing.",
        "answer_1": "As a person that operates 2 different types of 3D printers, I definitely do not think it is going to be a fad.  The amount of time and money companies save by doing 3D printing vs. traditional methods of prototyping are significant.

You can print ABS, Poly Carbonate, Clear plastic, Rubberized Plastic, Static Dissapative ABS, UV stable thermoplastic, FDM Nylon and ULTEM, just to name a few.

I recently increased my monthly payment from the minimum of $120 a month to $300 a month - I'll have my loan paid off in April 2024 and my servicer will have gotten more than $1,700 in interest from me.\nTo be honest, I'm sick of looking at this debt. I have $9,100 in my savings account which gives me 1.88% APY. Doing the math, it makes more sense to dump much of my savings onto the loan as it'd save me more money that what I'm making with the savings account. \nWhat I'm thinking about doing is dumping $6,100 from my savings onto the loan, which brings the loan balance down to about $8,544. I'll have $3,000 left in my savings as an emergency fund. I'll then increase my monthly payment to $900 a month which will get my loan paid off around July 2020 (this also leaves my with just over $100 a month extra after all my expenses like food, rent, car insurance, etc). My servicer will only get about $200 in interest from me by then.\nAfter the loan is paid off, assuming I don't get a raise between now and then, I'll have my student loan completely paid off which means I'll have $1,000 extra per month toward whatever I want - but I can easily get my savings built back up to what it was after months\nI've also considered other places to put my money that would earn me more, but I haven't come across anything with low risk and would yield greater than 4.875%. \nThere's definitely an emotional element to this - letting go of $6,100 is tough.

I filed for bankruptcy when I was 25 and now that I am 39 I have been trying very hard to manage my financial health.  5 years ago when i got married we checked out credit scores and mine was at around 500 , I checked mine again today and the report says I have no score. I am not sure where to go from here since I have not been able to secure a credit card in over a decade. Also, the personal information on my file is very outdated showing an address I haven't lived at in a decade and a last name I haven't had in 5 years.

Get a copy of your credit reports from all three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and review them carefully to make sure everything is accurate. Dispute any errors with the credit bureau(s).\n2. Consider freezing your credit reports to prevent identity theft while you work on rebuilding your credit.\n3. Apply for a secured credit card. These cards require a security deposit, which becomes your credit limit. Make small purchases each month and pay the balance off in full every billing cycle. This will show lenders that you're responsible with credit.\n4. Pay all bills on time, every time. Late payments will hurt your credit score.\n5. Don't apply for too many new lines of credit at once. Each application results in a hard inquiry on your credit report, which temporarily lowers your score.\n6. Wait. Rebuilding credit takes time. It may be several months before you see any significant improvement in your score.",

(Give them $500 and you get a card with a 500 dollar limit). They keep the cash for a year or so and have it on hand if you can't pay the card off. After the time frame passes it's reviewed and goes towards starting credit and they may approve you for thier actual credit card. You get your 500 back after the time frame or if you decide to close it. You can also (edit) build credit by getting some form of credit line with a cosigner who has good credit.",

Make sure they know that you normally stay because there is too much work to complete in your shift - but that for that one day you have an appointment. Then at 5:00, leave. If your boss has to step in and wrap up the work apologize but you have to get to an appointment. And that's why you told the boss that in advance.

The reason you won't get a good return on a CD is because the fed discount window is open. In other words your competing with interest rates set by the fed to loan money.    The Fed keeping interest rates low pretty much sabotages alot of financial products that are mean for consumer consumption.

In this meeting I began by telling him I was\n\nUnhappy with my compensation.\nThat because of my contributions to the company, X revenue was generated.\nThat because of 2., he could expect me to bring in Y revenue in the future.\nThat a 25% raise was eminently fair based on 2. and 3.\nAt this point, I knew that I was in for a dime, in for a dollar, so I asked for a bonus equal to 50% of my annual salary.\n\nHe told me that a 25% raise would make me the highest paid employee with my title, and that it was more in line with what managers were making. This invalidated what my coworker said (I always knew that was a possibility!), but I'd crossed the path of no return. I stood my ground.\nHe tried to fish for reasons why I came to him all of a sudden with such a huge compensation request. I told him I'd been putting off this conversation for a long time. I told him that I wasn't there to compare myself with other employees, that I was there to focus on what I could bring to the company, and what the company could justifiably pay me in return. I told him I knew the number was a bit arbitrary but I had to ask for something concrete.\nHe told me he would get back to me at the end of the day. 5:30 rolls around, and he pulls me into an office. He tells me that his boss and him carefully reviewed my request. He offers me the following:\n\n20% raise\n50% of my annual salary as a bonus\n\nI accepted, and we shook hands. Inside I was bubbling with glee but trying to keep my business face on. I thanked him and got up to leave. \nAs I left, he asked me not to share my compensation.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Congratulations, you played your cards right and got a significant raise and bonus. Don't break your boss's trust by sharing your new compensation with your coworker who made less. Keep quiet and enjoy your well-deserved reward.",
        "answer_1": "\nThis invalidated what my coworker said (I always knew that was a possibility!)\n\nNot as I recall.\n\n\nBefore you go off on your boss, consider that your co-worker might have been trolling you.\n\nI've considered that, but it seems extraordinarily unlikely. It also matches up with what I've been secretly suspecting for the past few months based on random chatter I've heard.\n",
        "answer_2": "You're a total stranger and I'm really happy you did this!  When I last saw your original thread it seemed like most people wanted you to suck it up and be a pussy.  Which shocked me as the majority reddit opinion usually mirrors my own.  I'm not sure if I posted or not in that thread, but I was wanting you to man-up and ask for the raise.  Very cool that you did.  Congrats, if we ever cross paths I'll buy you a beer. "

Before anyone asks: I have not discussed this with him and will not until I am certain I will do it. I will not discuss it in terms of a new loan and will ensure it is understood as a one time thing. \nSo, if I were to drop, let's say, $20k to kill his student loans, how much would I lose in taxes? Would I report it as a 'gift'? Perhaps it would be better if I just made his payments instead (probably not)?

        "prediction": "There could be several reasons why you're getting denied despite having a high credit score:\n\n1. Hard inquiries: Each time you apply for a new credit card, it results in a hard inquiry on your credit report. If you've recently applied for multiple cards, this could be causing lenders to see you as a higher risk. Wait at least 2-3 months between applications.\n\n2. Income: Some credit cards require a certain income level to qualify. Make sure you meet the minimum income requirements listed on the application.\n\n3. Length of Credit History: While your credit score is high, the length of your credit history might not be long enough to satisfy some lenders. Try applying for a card from a bank where you already have an account or relationship.\n\n4. Recent Activity: Have you made any large purchases or payments recently? Lenders may view these as signs that you're carrying too much debt or about to make a big purchase. Wait until things settle down before applying again.\n\n5. Previous Issues: Even if you currently have no balances, there could still be something negative on your credit report that's preventing approval. Check your credit reports for errors or past issues like collections or late payments.\n\nIn general, it's best to only apply for credit when you actually need it rather than trying to \"game\" the system by applying for lots of cards at once.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nHow to calculate a pension or pension increases vs. savings for retirement TLDR: Golden Handcuffs question. How to calculate the equivalence of a pension vs retirement savings accounts. \nSo, I am one of the lucky few to have a pension. I am already vested. The way it is structured is based on years worked, age and highest average earnings over a 3 year period. Just got a promotion last year. Am in the last few stages of my pre FIRE life. I'm trying to evaluate whether to work 2 1/2 more years or 1 1/2 more years. \nI will be able to meet our expected expenses (with some room to spare) with 403b, IRAs and pension in 1 1/2 more years.  But, if I worked one more year, I would get about $8k more per year in my pension (67k vs 75k per year).   This would give us a nice cushion. \nBut, my job is quite stressful with this promotion and I don't know if it's worth it. \nOne way to calculate the worth of a pension would be to value it at the 4% withdrawal rate. So, 8k would equal $200,000 in a retirement account.  However, when my spouse and I both pass, there will be no assets left from this theoretical sum. So another way to calculate it would be to estimate my life expectancy and then a withdrawal rate that would spend down the principal in that time. I think this would be around a 8% withdrawal rate for me.  That would mean that an 8k increase = 100,000 in retirement savings. \nAny thoughts on this?  \nThe reason I am asking is that most FIRE or other retirement calculations are based on a pot of money that you withdraw from and not from a pension. \n$8k per year is a nice reliable increase, but frankly, my stress might not be worth it. This equivalency scenario seems to be one that would help me make the decision. \nThanks!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Your pension is guaranteed income for life, while your retirement savings are subject to market volatility and potentially running out.

Assuming a 4% safe withdrawal rate, you'd need $200,000 saved up.\n- If you die before spending all of your retirement savings, your heirs won't receive any additional money from your pension. They may inherit whatever is left in your retirement accounts.\n- Your pension does not count against your Social Security benefits, whereas your retirement savings do.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to which you prefer - a guaranteed income stream for life, or taking on the risk and responsibility of managing your own investments.",

",
        "answer_2": "There's a rule of thumb that every $100/month of pension is worth about $18,000 (alternatively$1000/yr = $15,000) at retirement. This means that this extra $8k of pension could be worth around $120k (similar to your math). Obviously, to get a more accurate number you have to factor in inflation, age, life expectancy, etc. That being said, a $67k pension is quite a nest egg already (worth about $1M) so the answer depends on your expenses and whether the pension is inflation-adjusted.\nTo help with your FIRE calculations, I would recommend the [\"Rich, Broke, or Dead\" Early Retirement Calculator](  treating the pension and other benefits like Social Security separate from your investments in the \"Extra Income\" tab. This will give you a probability of whether or not you will have enough money in retirement."

I have almost a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet that I have been paying on for a couple of years now (terrible I know). Late last year, I hit some hard times and missed a couple of payments (again, terrible, I know). Because my Nelnet account is split 10 different ways, they hit my credit 10 different times for each late payment, resulting in 20 negative statements on my credit for only 2 actual missed payments. \nI tried to work with Nelnet to consolidate those late payments into just two, but they were unwilling to work with me on that. After some more research, I ended up disputing the late payments with the three bureaus. My justification simply asked that they consolidate the missed payments down to the two that actually occurred.\nLast week, I received a statement from Equifax saying that the account information on my Nelnet accounts had been updated, which I thought was good news, but further inspection showed that all the late payments were still present.\nFast forward to today when I checked my credit report on CreditKarma to see that the late payments with Nelnet had ballooned from 20 to 40. Additionally, my recorded payment history went from something like 650 down to 447 payments on file. \nHow is this possible? The adviser at Nelnet suggested I consolidate, which would not take care of anything in the past, but might look good on my credit report. Essentially, those accounts would be closed down and a new one opened up. Can't this hurt me?\nI am now in a great financial position, but I'm being smothered by the mistakes of my past. I want to buy a house and start progressing a little bit, but I'm stuck. What can I do? I'm lost.\nThanks for reading. Any advice is welcome.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "You need to stop disputing the late payments. They happened, and you can't change that. Consolidating your loans won't erase the past either - it will just give you a single new loan with a single due date instead of multiple ones. Your best bet is to get back on track with making your payments on time going forward, and wait for the late payments to age off your credit report (they stay on for 7 years). Buying a house with multiple late payments on your record is unlikely unless you have an extremely high income or large downpayment.",
        "answer_1": "Well. You don't have \"a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet\", you have 10 federal loans all serviced by Nelnet. Each loan was disbursed separately, and can have varying terms. Borrowers typically end up with 1-2 loans per year, one subsidized, one unsubsidized.\nSo yea, you actually have 10 loans, and 10 missed payments each time. If you look at the credit bureaus reports they'll show the 10 accounts too.\nThere's pretty much nothing you can do about that.",
        "answer_2": "I'm in the exact same position. Just call nelnet or w/e other lender has your loans and consolidate into 1. I've talked to them and there's no penalties (of course everyone has different terms) for consolidating into 1 account and making a single payment a month. After you make a few payments your credit will start to skyrocket. Only takes a few payments to see results. "

Without collective bargaining power, individual workers have less leverage to negotiate better salaries.\n\n3.

Hi all, I am leaving my job next week to go to medical school at the end of the summer and would like some advice on what to do with my 401k account from my employer. I have about $3200 vested balance. I know I can cash it out (which from what I've read is generally not advised) or I can roll it over into another type of account (IRA?). I am 25 and feel like cashing it out would be useful in having some extra money set aside for the move to a new state; but, leaving it alone would be smart for my long-term goals even though I wouldn't be able to contribute any additional money until residency I'm guessing.  Thanks in advance.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Rolling it over into an IRA is almost always the best option here. Cashing out triggers taxes and penalties if you are under age 59 1/2. Leaving it in your old company's 401(k) means you lose control over it and may face higher fees. Rolling it into an IRA gives you more investment options and allows you to continue growing those funds tax free until retirement. You won't be contributing anything else to a retirement account during med school anyway, so there's no need to touch this now.",
        "answer_1": "You'll pay taxes and a 10% penalty if you cash the 401k out. So, you won't end up with much.  Transfer it to a low cost or no cost fund at Vanguard or Fidelity.  Call and a representative will be happy to walk you through the process.  It's easy and I've done it.",
        "answer_2": "Leave it where it is. If your income trajectory takes you above the income limit for a Roth IRA, rolling over to a Traditional IRA will cause extra work for you if you choose to later do a backdoor Roth conversion. Unless the fees in the 401(k) are crazy, just let it sit."

Create a budget: Start by listing all of your expenses, including rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation costs, insurance premiums, loan payments, etc. Make sure you're not overspending in any category.\n2. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in case of unexpected events like losing your job or medical emergencies.\n3. Pay down debt: Focus on paying off high-interest debt first, such as credit card balances or personal loans. If your student loans have low interest rates, consider putting extra money towards saving instead.\n4. Contribute to retirement: Take advantage of any employer matching programs for your 401(k) or other retirement accounts. This is free money!\n5. Live below your means: Remember that just because you can afford something doesn't mean you should buy it. Stick to your budget and avoid unnecessary expenses.\n6. Review your benefits: Make sure you understand what your health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and any other employee benefits cover.\n7. Network: Get to know your coworkers and superiors. Building relationships within your company could lead to promotions or future opportunities.\n8. Learn about your industry: Attend conferences, read trade publications, and network outside of work to stay informed about trends and best practices in your field.\n9. Don't quit your good habits: Just because you're making more money now doesn't mean you should start splurging. Keep living frugally and saving money where possible.",

At first I thought he was messing with me because who buys a boat unseen? \nHe saw my ad on craiglist and wanted to buy my boat and pay three months non liveaboard dock rent (my houseboat comes with a slip.) I agreed and I gave him the pricing six thousand for the boat (asking price, he didn't haggle me) and one thousand three hundred and seventy two dollars for three months of dock rent. \nHe agreed to the pricing and we decided PayPal was the safest bet to send the money. \nHe chose buyer and seller to send the money with me covering the fees ( I offered) and I would send him the title and proof of paying the three months rent and a bill of sale with as in no warranty on it. \nHe did send the money and its sitting in my paypal balance. \nMy question is, can this go wrong?

You could also ask them to provide a notarized letter stating their intent to purchase the boat.\n\n2. Insist on meeting in person: While this may seem counterintuitive since the buyer is out of state, you should at least arrange to meet somewhere nearby where a local law enforcement officer can witness the transfer of ownership. This will make it much harder for the buyer to claim later that the boat wasn't what they expected or that they never received it.\n\n3. Get legal advice: Consult an attorney experienced in maritime law to ensure your paperwork is correct and legally binding. They can help draft a bill of sale and transfer documents that clearly outline the terms of the sale and protect your interests.\n\n4. Don't rush into the transaction: Take your time and allow yourself plenty of time to complete the sale. Rushing into a deal can lead to mistakes and oversights that could cost you dearly down the road.\n\n5. Trust your instincts: If something feels off or too good to be true, it probably is.

But you really need to take extra steps to protect yourself.\nThat means get his name and address, validate it by getting his driver's license, include any title information, have him sign that and complete the title transfer in person, with you there. Make sure everything matches. If he refunds it via paypal you have the info to sue, if it's fake you will know that the title was marked up with fake info and can go about the process of getting it voided (though it's probably already void, if he filled it out with fake info he won't get that boat registered anywhere and won't be able to sell it) and then the boat can be reported stolen.\nAs long as the transaction is done in person, with a written signed contract, you can just sue in court to get it if a refund is attempted.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\n~15k in checking, no savings. Is it worth opening a savings account? Hey guys,\nI make roughly 55k/year and have around 15k at any given time in my checking account. Is it worth it for me to open a savings account? It seems with current interest rates it's hardly worth the trouble. My checking account is with a major bank and I was thinking of opening a savings account with the same bank simply to \"set aside\" money. Thoughts? Thanks!\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Yes, absolutely. While the interest rate may be low right now, having an emergency fund or saving up for a goal is still important. Even if you only earn $0.01% interest on your savings, that's better than keeping all your money in a checking account where you might accidentally spend it. Look into high-yield online savings accounts as well - they offer higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar banks.",
        "answer_1": "Am I the only one who doesn't like a bunch of money in their checking account for security reasons? I used to be a software engineer in the banking world and you wouldn't believe the scams that would happen through check fraud and ACH transactions. ",
        "answer_2": "Yes usually. The best reason, at least for me, is to ensure that something like the Target/Home Depot \"hacks' can't ever empty your full savings, which should never be in your checking etc.\nOrganizationally it also makes saving for different goals and putting your money into different separate buckets a lot easier."

I've paid off my annoying loans, only things left are my wife's car and my mortgage. I'm building a nest egg...I've got 3k on hand in savings, always between 3-5K in checking, and looking to grow another 12k this year as my oh shit I lost my job emergency fund, probably in an investment account somewhere. No issues with debt:income ratio. I don't mind buying stuff for my kids or wife, but I feel guilty as hell buying things for myself. For example, on a whim I bought my wife and kid a Switch (Pokemon themed) on launch day for Lets Go Pikach  (they are both huge Pokemon fans, I couldn't give a poke less). $400 spend, no fuck given. But I sit here kicking my ass about spending $30 on a video game for myself, or Gods forbid, thinking about a VR setup at home that would cost about the same as the Switch did.\nLast week I got an unexpected decent check from my mortgage company due to an escrow overage. $850. I could easily have it be fun money...but naw, my first instinct was to squirrel it away and get some maintenance done on the wife's car, because it was easier to do that mentally then to even consider what I could just blow it on.\nHow do you justify spending some cash on yourself?\n<|assistant|>\n",

You work hard, you pay your bills, you save responsibly - treating yourself every once in a while is not selfish, it's necessary for your own wellbeing.

        "answer_2": "My trick is to find a way to turn it into spending on others!\nSo for example if I wanna see a movie, I make sure to go see it with a friend--so instead of 12 bucks invested in a movie it's 12 bucks invested in the friendship. Same with eating out or going to an event, which I only do once a month or so anyways. \nSo a video game is something maybe you and your kid can enjoy, so it's not all on yourself.

It is listed as an investment, and the listing indicates that there is another hookup for a mobile home on the back acre.\nThere were showings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. All of which listed location, surroundings, and the trailers as reasons why they were not interested.\nEdited to add: The street is a dead in street. There is one way in and one way out. When a prospective buyer turns into the street, they see this:  \nThere is no diverting people away from seeing the shitty trailorhood.\nEdited to add:\nThe only comp on my street/in the neighborhood is this house:  \nIt sold for $162,500 last year. It also had a good bit of land with it, and the house had not been updated. However it is not a pier & beam house. But the back of the property did flood in the 2016 flood resulting in a workshop being flooded out (and they did not rebuild or renovate the workshop). My property did not flood. They listed around $180K if I'm not mistaken. It was on the market 88 days before it was sold. \n--\nHow does one calculate how much they will come down when they lower the price due to a shitty trailerhood?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Unfortunately, you don't get to decide how much to come down based on your own feelings about the neighborhood. You have to look at what similar properties in better areas are selling for, and adjust your price accordingly. In this case, since the only comparable sale in the area sold for less than asking price, you should consider reducing your price by a similar amount. Remember, potential buyers aren't going to be impressed by the size of your property if they're put off by the surrounding trailers.",
        "answer_1": "So let me start by saying I'm an investor in BR and surrounding areas. I'm familiar with where you're house is and the area. \nI took a look at your listing and my original thought is you're massively overpriced. The rents in that area are low and you're in the middle of nowhere. I can't speak for all investors out here, but at that price point you can't compete with houses in BR that will attract the LSU crowd as well as families. The only people that want to live in that area are going to be people that grew up in that area. The house also needs work. The first things I would do is paint all the dark wood white, redo kitchen counters, add new appliances, and something needs to be done with that bathroom. I'd estimate 10-15K in costs. For a similar sized house in similar shape in BR I'd expect to pay 80-100K. Sure, I wouldn't have the yard you have, but I would never want that sized lot for a rental anyway. All in all, I think you're making a mistake trying to market as an investment. \nYou're also competing with so many houses that just got remodeled/flipped from the flood. I have a buddy that just bought a totally updated house that's 700 sq/ft larger than yours off of Millerville (closer to civilization) for about 20K less. \nI think you'd be better off just lowering the price and selling to someone who wants to stay in that area and is already comfortable seeing trailers here and there.\nIf I were you I'd ask my realtor to show me these comps again. I can't imagine there are comps supporting this price point.",
        "answer_2": "You have to find some comps. You're looking for overimprovements in nearby or similar hoods. Or you go back in time (years, if needed, how active the market was is not a huge consideration, you're looking for percentage of discount). If the demographics on the other side of town are kinda the same, you can use those places to estimate the discount. It's a fairly complex assignment for an appraiser who has access to all that data, and it's slightly better than a wild ass guess, but it's not as scientific as anyone would like. Would cost $300-$400 but you need an appraiser who likes puzzles not someone who needs a target number to hit. \nJust another option, if the place is on 2 acres can you carve off a couple homesites for trailers (especially if you have utilities already on one). If you sold 2 1/2 acre sites that would be some money in your pocket that would allow you to accept less for the house. OR add this fact (if it's legally possible) to the marketing info and maybe an investor will pick the place up and do the lot split). You say it's listed as an investment but who knows what that means, if you can split the lot make sure that is prominently mentioned in the listing. \nIf you are having showings, I'd not be inclined to drop the price too much (if anything). That means you haven't turned off buyers with the price. Someone will make you an offer, you can counter, and see where you can meet. We get spoiled by markets where things sell in days but realistically 2-3 months is a normal marketing time in many markets. You may need longer than typical marketing time and that's fine if you can hold out for your price. \nAnother thing you might consider is seeing if your agent will get other agents to come take a look and give their opinion on your price. Kinda like they do on tv shows where the realtors tour the flips and say it's overpriced lol. But you will get some opinions from people who work in the area and know the market. It's also kinda guerilla marketing because those realtors have clients who might not have seen it otherwise, it doesn't hurt to have it on more people's radar. "

Maxing out retirement accounts: You should be contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA regardless of whether it's December or June. There's no advantage to waiting until December.\n\n2. Standardized deductions/personal exemptions: These are based on your income for the entire year, not just the last two months.

Prepared to do 1000 in down. (Car dealership had signs saying 9999 for a car. And, my old clunker bit it somewhat suddenly. So I thought,\"cheap new car.\") They only had no feature stickshifts for this price of course. \nI don't drive stick and we haggled for a pre-owned certified automatic for 16000. Not sure if I was getting taken by sales person, but the car was nice and on initial inspection I could afford the payments. So I went for it. Drove off lot after signing papers and  am super pumped about the car.\nA few weeks later I got a letter saying the financing was not approved and loan was denied due to insufficient credit info.\nSo now the loan isn't going to work, what options do I have? Do we renegotiate the loan?(will I get a worse loan?) Do I have to return the car? Do I get my down payment back? I'm going to talk to the dealer tomorrow but I'm stressing and don't know my options.\nTLDR: Got talked into buying more car than I planned for, and now am not approved for the upgraded loan. Don't know my options or if this is a bad situation. New car feels like it ain't pulling it's weight.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "You should never have agreed to buy a car without financing being already arranged. You need to go back to the dealer with a copy of that approval letter and explain the situation. The dealer may be able to help you find another lender, or they may let you keep the car at the original terms (downpayment and all). However, since you didn't actually sign any paperwork for the higher loan amount, there's little chance you'll \"get stuck\" with a worse loan - unless the dealer tries some shady tactics, which would be against the law. But again, you shouldn't have bought the car without financing first.",
        "answer_1": "\nGot talked into buying more car than I planned for\n\nThen this loan falling through may be a great situation for you. They most likely gave you the car on the condition that the loan would go through (check your paperwork for such a clause). It did not go through. So you can either try to arrange your own financing or else return the car and get your down payment back. I suggest the latter.\nAnd be sure to use this as a learning experience - always know the maximum you can afford, never go over that, and do research on the particular car you are looking at before you buy. Don't simply trust that whatever random car the salesman shows you is fit for your needs.",
        "answer_2": "Talk to the dealer first and foremost and find out who they actually had the loan approved with. If they spot delivered you (delivered without an approval in place), your contracts will show no lienholder assigned, so review them and find out what institution, if any, picked up the note. \nOften, especially with less than perfect credit, we do what's called \"shotgunning\". The finance manager selects 3 to 4 of the most likely banks to get an approval with, then \"shotguns\" your application out to them. Sometimes one picks it up, sometimes, none do, and sometimes they all do. It really depends. The number of banks go up if you have particularly challenged credit. The important thing is that we are required to send you a letter saying you were denied for credit EVEN IF THE BANK APPROVES YOU! If the terms change from what they originally approved (a counter approval) or if you decline to finance with one of the banks, you will get AAN's from any institution that didn't capture your business or captured your business with a counter approval. \nTLDR: Could be an AAN or could have been spot delivered. If it's the former, don't worry about it. If it's the latter, be prepared to have to fight your way out of a contract that claims you owe money for use of the vehicle (typically $50/day,  $0.50/mile in my state)."

The lender will provide you with financing for both the purchase price and the renovation costs, all rolled into one mortgage.

Additionally, you may need to have a detailed plan and budget for the renovations, as well as proof that you have sufficient funds left over to make your monthly payments even while the work is being done.

Houses in our price range seem to go very quickly.\nToday I decided to switch it up and my realtor took me to a house a little bit inland in one of the most affluent towns with a great school system. The house is small (960 sq feet), directly next to a park, and pretty poorly laid out.\nIf we were to make an offer, we would slowly work on updating different aspects of the house, hopefully eventually adding on a bedroom, additional bathroom, and a laundry room on the second floor.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nIs there any way student loans being wiped away can trigger another financial crisis? Apparently, student loans are being wiped away due to the carelessness of companies buying student loan debt. Anyone have any idea if this could feasibly trigger some kind of financial crisis if the balance sheet of a bunch of these companies go bad? \n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "It's highly unlikely that student loan forgiveness will trigger another financial crisis. Here's why:\n\n1. Student Loan Forgiveness is not new: The US government has been offering various forms of student loan relief for decades now. In fact, President Obama signed into law in December 2020, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief package which included an extension on student loan repayment suspension until September 30, 2021 and also provided temporary relief from interest accrual during this time period. This means that lenders have already accounted for such possibilities while structuring their business models.\n\n2. Government Backing: Most student loans are guaranteed by the federal government, meaning that private entities purchasing them do so with the understanding that they will be paid back regardless of whether or not the borrower defaults. This significantly reduces risk for investors.\n\n3. Limited Impact: While it's true that some companies may suffer losses as a result of student loan forgiveness, the overall impact would likely be limited. According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, total outstanding student loan debt stands at around $1.7 trillion. Even if all of that were to be forgiven (which is extremely unlikely), it still wouldn't come close to the size of the subprime mortgage market that triggered the last financial crisis ($10.4 trillion).\n\nIn short, while student loan forgiveness may cause some headaches for certain industries, it's not going to lead to another financial crisis.",
        "answer_1": "Naw. Student loans aren't really a systemic risk to financial institutions like mortgages are. The biggest issue with student loan debt is the \"ball and chain\" effect it's having on the economy. Best way to deal with it in my mind is to completely restructure public primary education as well as higher education so people aren't pushed into taking out huge loans for degrees of dubious value and just wait for existing underperforming student debt to \"go away.\"",
        "answer_2": "The loans in question were already charged off by the originating banks, so there wouldn't be a big effect on the national economy.

It's a crazy life choice, but I've gone ahead and made it anyway, and the last couple of years have been good ones for me. My best ones, in fact. Was able to quit the catering grind and act full time.\nHere's my current situation: I've been able to pay down a lot of student debt (currently have it under 10k), I finally opened up a Roth IRA and maxed it out, I've got a mutual fund worth about 18k and I've got about 50k in a savings account paying about 1% interest (don't ya miss those 4.5% glory days??).\nMy current gig grosses me about 122k a year. It's awesome but it could end at any moment, though chances are I've got at least another 6-12 months of job security, possibly more.\nSo what do I do with my money? Keeping it in savings where it earns 1% feels like I'm missing some golden opportunities, but the nature of my job is such that I feel like it's important to keep a degree of liquidity for when unemployment rears its head again (which it will). CDs aren't paying much, savings accounts don't provide much, which seems to leave me with stocks. But the sense I get from this community when it comes to the stock market (ie. index funds, 3-part lazy portfolio) is that I should set and forget and be prepared to not touch that money for a long time. Any savings I'd want to do would have to be short-term to moderate-term.\nWhat should I do? Am I being overly conservative by keeping the bulk of my money in savings? Would love y'alls thoughts.\n(Incidentally, I currently rent an apartment for about $1100 a month.

Emergency Fund - You already mentioned having a degree of liquidity, but I think you need to increase it. Since your income is variable, aim for 3-6 months expenses in emergency fund. This means calculating all your necessary expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, etc.) and saving enough to cover them for 3-6 months.\n\n2. Maximize Retirement Savings - Continue contributing the maximum ($5500/year) to your Roth IRA. If you make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA, then consider opening a traditional IRA or 401k through your employer if they offer one.\n\n3. Pay off Student Debt - With only $10K left, you might want to consider accelerated repayment methods like the snowball method or avalanche method.\n\n4. Housing Decision - While buying a house may seem appealing, I wouldn't recommend it right now since you still have high levels of uncertainty regarding your employment status. Renting allows you to maintain flexibility while also building wealth through rental payments.\n\nOverall, you're on the right track.

        "prediction": "Real estate can be a great way to generate extra income, but it's not necessarily the best option for everyone. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Initial investment: Buying a property requires a significant upfront investment, which may not be feasible for everyone. You also need to factor in closing costs and ongoing expenses like property taxes, insurance, and maintenance.\n\n2. Risk: Real estate is not without risks. The value of your property could decrease, tenants might stop paying rent, or there could be unexpected repairs that eat into your profits.\n\n3. Time commitment: Being a landlord involves more than just collecting rent checks. You'll have to deal with tenant issues, handle repairs, and manage finances. This can take a lot of time and effort.\n\n4. Leverage: Borrowing money to buy multiple properties (known as leveraging) can increase returns on investment, but it also increases risk.\n\n5. Diversification: Investing all your extra income in one asset class (real estate) can leave you exposed to market fluctuations. It's generally recommended to diversify your investments across different types of assets.\n\nThat being said, if you enjoy managing properties, have enough capital to cover initial expenses, and understand the risks involved, then investing in real estate can certainly be a smart choice for generating extra income. Just make sure to do your research and consult with a financial advisor before making any major decisions.",
        "answer_1": "\nWhy not\n\nA few reasons. One, it locks up a considerable amount of capital in a single asset.\nTwo, it's subject to potentially high risk. If you get a difficult-to-evict tenant, then you're still on the hook for HOA/mortgage/utilities while your tenant is both not paying rent and potentially damaging the home.\nThree, it's not as hands-off as you'd think. You have to write invoices, deal with tenant needs, etc. I'm at the point now where I spend maybe 2-4 hours a month on my rental properties (unless I've got a move-in/move-out to attend to). But that's after years of getting things automated to a point I'm happy with.\nFour, long-term asset valuation is difficult. Investing in Detroit real estate probably looked like a brilliant idea back in the 50's. Investing in Vegas and Florida condos was all the rage 10 years ago. Bubbles burst.\nFifth, property appreciation is \"nice,\" but unrealized unless you actually sell. Once you sell, the property is no longer providing any cash flow. Thus, a lot of people invest and end up losing money for years and years.\nReal estate is a useful part of any investment portfolio. However, as 2008 evidenced, being inexperienced can cause it to be a fool's errand. I own a few properties, but I don't think I'll be acquiring any more unless I see a really good deal.",
        "answer_2": "Because it requires a type of work that some people don't enjoy. Some people don't like placing listings or doing major upkeep or market research or paying a property manager to do those things.\nIt also requires a decent amount of money in case you don't have tenants for a few months (or worse yet, you have terrible tenants).

I make around $17/hour and work full time. I do not plan to move and have also had the same employeer for 4 years. The biggest reason for the push to buy comes from the ever increasing cost of rent.

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nTIL I'm worth $900,000. I'm 32yo. Unmarried. I've handled my own investing and finances. Should I keep doing that or hire a wealth management firm? Please excuse me if I come off as a braggard. I know that I'm very fortunate and lucky and that other people are not doing so well. I'm grateful for everything I have.\nI'm basically a hypersaver. Have saved and invested almost every penny I have ever made. I have about $200,000 in cash accounts. The rest is split between self-directed brokerage accounts, a 401k, an HSA and a Roth IRA. I do not have a financial adviser and I'm heavily invested in US large-cap equities, particularly value technology stocks and financials. Very little bond exposure, very little international exposure.\nManaging my own investments the past ten years has been exhausting. The 2008 financial crisis nearly gave me a stroke, I was so stressed. I luckily stayed in the game and kept buying in '09 with what little cash I had left and through dumb luck, have recouped my losses.\nWould I be better served by hiring a wealth manager? Do I even have enough to hire one? I called US Trust and they said I needed at least $3 million. Can you suggest any others that are reputable? Thank you.\nEDIT - I've been asked what my background in finance and investing is. None. I read the Wall Street Journal and several business news wires every day as part of my job. One of my majors in undergrad was economics, which qualifies me for jack shit. And I've learned from the enormous mistakes that I have made trading stocks. That's it. \nI do not short stocks, I do not trade on margin and I do not enter into futures contracts. Too risky and too time consuming for my tastes. I do not have the stomach for that kind of speculation.\nEDIT 2 - I've been asked how I made my money. I was lucky enough to land a job with a startup media company out of law school. They offered me commissions based on subscriber growth and when the company exploded higher, I benefited. It was a huge gamble, but it paid off. I was lucky. Prior to this, I was a starving student and had a lower-middle class upbringing.\nThe best advice I can give someone young and ambitious is to take a job that pays you for your results as opposed to paying you for your time.\n<|assistant|>\n",

While having $900K is impressive, managing such a significant net worth without proper guidance could lead to costly mistakes.

You may want to look for firms that specialize in serving clients with your level of assets rather than those requiring $3M. Some reputable options include Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, Betterment Premium, and Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium. However, before making any decisions, I would recommend consulting with a few different advisors to find the right fit for you.",

Take notes on the services they offer and which of those services, if any, are valuable to you. For some clients I provide guidance in every aspect of their portfolio. Other clients just want me to be a sounding board to bounce their own theories off of. Some want to beat the market. Some just want to set long term goals and have me develop and hold them to a strategy for reaching those goals. Some clients just see me as a glorified banker that moves their money around and buys them dinner sometimes. And a couple, it seems, hired me and pay me to manage their finances because they want someone to call and talk to sometimes. I honestly feel like they view it as paying for a friend. We are told details about some of the most personal aspects of our clients lives because all those details ultimately have some affect on their finances. ",

I believe there will be other favourable opportunities to pick out soon. For example, given we are due a recession, you can pick the bottom of the cycle again and pick stocks you think will recover or are oversold.\n\n\nCasinos and so on are a risky industry. From a macro perspective, I'd say cash out. You've stuck at it 8 years, it is time to move on.\n\n\nTry to pick out stocks that are guaranteed to do well as our world economy restructures in the 2020's, or on the other hand, from a micro perspective ones you know something more than the average joe about ;) Ideally not competitive industries.\n\n\nAll the best!"

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nShould I plan to buy my parents an annuity? My parents are getting close to retirement age (60 and 61) and don't have much saved. I haven't discussed exact numbers with them, but I'd estimate they have ~100k in savings. Currently my dad makes ~55k as a truck driver and my mom makes 5-10k part time. They didn't work in the US until age 45, hence the lack of savings. \nThey expect to get 1400/month total from social security once they hit 66. It's not that much, because they won't have been paying in for the full 35 years.\nMy dad thinks he will have to work until he dies. His job is very hard on him -- most driving is at night, his hours are always changing, and he gets very little time off. Coming home for the holidays, I feel very sorry for him. \nI haven't told them, but I'd like to help make it possible for my dad to retire in 5-6 years, around 66. The good news is that their house is paid off, they live in a low cost of living area, and they're reasonably frugal, so if he retired I think they could live on 25-30k/yr. \nI'm 24 and in my 3rd year of grad school working toward a PhD. I live on a 40k/yr stipend, plus about 10k/yr from side jobs. I live with 5 housemates on rice and beans, so I've managed to save ~90k since starting grad school. My income should increase to ~80k/yr when I graduate in 2.5 years, and then hopefully keep increasing slowly if I make it in academia. If I don't, it should increase faster. I don't have any debt. \nSo, the idea I'm considering is: use a large fraction of my savings over the next 5-6 years to buy them an annuity that pays out 1k/month. It appears this would cost me roughly 175k. Combined with social security and their savings, this should hopefully be enough that my dad can retire. This would of course set me back quite a bit in my own finances, but I'm young enough that I think I should still be ok. My parents made big sacrifices career-wise for me and my sister throughout their lives, so I'm willing to take a hit. \nI guess an alternative to buying an annuity would be to just set up an automated transfer to give them 1k/month. I like that the annuity is guaranteed, so they wouldn't have to worry that I would stop giving them money for any reason. I think if I proposed to just send them money every month, they would probably refuse. Same for a lump sum gift. \nDoes this sound like a reasonable plan? Do people still use annuities for retirement? Are there other better ways to help your aging parents? \n<|assistant|>\n",

Instead, you might consider setting up a trust or gifting them some money each month directly.

They should spend down that savings as a means to supplement their retirement income with you only needling to backstop them 20+ years from now, get a life insurance policy if you are concerned they may outlive you.\n&x200B\nI would not dig into your savings to essentially fund their retirement now when they really don't appear to need your assistance for at least several decades, at which point you will have a stable career, a substantially higher income and given your frugal habits a substantial net worth.",

It'll give you a reason to pay attention to the market and get a feel for how it moves.\n - Throw some into some companies or an industry you're interested in.

Graduated high school and got my diploma three years ago but I've been struggling to put my life together past that point. Sometime within that three-year period I came down with a partial disability that severely limits my ability to work.\nBecause of this, I've held numerous jobs (cashier, lubrication technician, server, etc.) but haven't been able to hold them because the physical nature of these jobs was simply too taxing and I was forced to quit.

Be sure to emphasize that you enjoy working there and believe that the new role deserves commensurate compensation. If possible, bring data about salaries for similar roles in your area. Give your employer time to respond before making any decisions, but don't delay this conversation for too long. It's better to address the issue head-on rather than waiting until resentment builds.",
        "answer_1": "I think you need to wait and see exactly what you will be doing and if it is truly above the pay grade.  Like the previous poster stated you may be getting trained for more responsibilities. I think the question is... are you really proficient enough after training, with no experience in those new tasks, to demand payment?",
        "answer_2": "Slightly off-topic but I always find this perspective a bit confused. If a company needs to hire a medical doctor to sit at the front desk and answer phones, they aren't posting the job at $10/hr, they're posting it at $250k/yr. And the converse is true too. If the hospital needs to hire low skilled labor to provide some service to patients, even if the service is highly important or it comes with the title, Head of Whatever, the job isn't going to pay much.\nYour comp is based a lot more on you than the position. You have a value in the marketplace. Not every job is going to be a good fit for you. But if you take a job answering phones and they want you to sweep floors instead, your comp doesn't go down, they're just overpaying you to be a janitor. If you take a job answering phones and they want you to take a bunch of responsibility for other aspects of the business, they're not underpaying you, they're just training you for free to do stuff you're currently unqualified for.

I'm also in school part-time taking a program to strengthen my skills in a specialized field.\nCurrently I have about $6000 in my chequing account. I just received a windfall payment from a wealthy relative for $10,000. I have $3,500 in a tax-free savings account.\nI'm currently owing $11,000 on my car at 3.4% interest. $95 gets debited from my account bi-weekly. I'm eager to pay this off sooner than later, but it does have a very low interest rate.\nI have a credit card where I owe $5,000. Interest rate is 13.9%.\nI have a student line of credit where I owe $14,000. Interest rate is 4.2%.\nMy rent is $575 per month. Car insurance is $70/month; cell phone $60/month.

And most importantly, don't let fear cloud your judgment - losing $1m would be terrible, but working with a bad advisor could make it much worse.",
        "answer_1": "[Throwaway account here]\nMy wife and I were in a similar situation a few years back, so here is some random advice for you to consider, for what it is worth:\n\n\n$1M seems like an insane amount of money, but it can go super-fast.  I recommend not buying anything for a while, and plan very carefully.  Pay off credit cards, though.  \n\n\nYea, you can get a cool car and a remodel on the house, etc., but you can also let that money work for you for a while via investments.  When we first got wind of our money, we made a plan, with some of it going towards a $80K Mercedes SUV, etc., and I am now in hindsight so super glad we didn't buy that kind of stuff.  Take your time to really plan - don't just make a list of what you want to buy.\n\n\nYou might be looking at \"Wealth Manager\" more so than \"Financial advisor\", though $1M is maybe a little low for that, I'm not sure.  We shopped around for wealth managers, had some recommendations from friends, etc., but ended up only having a small amount under that control, as kind of a secondary backup plan.  (We ended up with RBC Wealth Management\n\n\nReally get references for advisors and managers, and recognise that they may be looking more out for themselves than for you.\n\n\nRead all you can before making big decisions.  We read every single \"Investment For Dummies\" books.  I actually liked those a lot because the Dummies brand wants to protect their brand more than push an agenda.  Read them all.\n\n\nAnother absolute must read is \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham.  I have literally doubled our money by following this simple advice over about 3 or so years.  You will need to know the basics of investing, per the Dummies books, before reading this, but I strongly recommend it.  (Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's Mentor)\n\n\nConsider that with $1M you can now be an accredited investor.  That means, you can buy into various companies that are not publically traded.  This can be a lot of fun.  Learn about angel investing and the like, find some groups that do it, and if it is of interest to you, be very careful, picky, and spread your risk.   This is not for everyone, though, and very risky.   We personally have small investments ($2K to $15K) spread out over several such investments totaling maybe $50K.  It will be quite a few years before we know if that was a good idea, but they were companies that we felt were doing good in the world, so are okay losing it.\n\n\nKeep it to yourself.  Your friends don't need to know your good fortune.  All that would do is incite jealousy, which really is not something you want, as tempting as it may be.\n\n\nConsider always keeping a reserve so you can quit your job at any moment.  Having the knowledge that you always have that freedom may make your job more fun.  \n\n\nDon't forget others.  Share some of your good fortune.  Invest in the world around you.\n\n\nHope something here is of some help.  Congratulations on your good fortune.",
        "answer_2": "U/secretmillionaire123 made some great points, agree with what he said. Our finance system is very different here in Australia, but I'm hoping I might be able to offer some useful advice. \nMost financial planners/advisors will be selling you products that make them the most money. Do your research on any advisor, ask them how they're paid (avoid any advisor that is paid by commission such as the one you mentioned you'd seen). Look for someone who will charge you a 'fee for service', preferably someone from an independent firm too. \nFind out if there is an industry body with a professional standard of conduct and education like the FPA in Australia. Get someone who has post graduate qualifications in finance also. You advisor should be extensively researching your situation as well as the products they're recommending so be wary of an advisor who doesn't ask lots of questions. \nThat being said, if you're intelligent and interested and willing to put the work in, you're better off doing it yourself.

However, we can provide some objective advice:\n\nTaking on debt (even interest-free debt) just to accelerate paying off a mortgage isn't always the best move. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. Opportunity cost - What could you do with that extra $50K over those two years instead? Could you invest it and earn more than the interest rate you'd save by paying off the mortgage faster?\n\n2. Liquidity - By tying up $50K in a condo, you lose the flexibility to use that money for other purposes (e.g., starting a business, moving for a job opportunity).\n\n3. Quality of life - Living frugally for two years might be tougher than you think. Are you prepared to give up experiences/activities now in order to have a paid-off condo later?\n\n4. Risk - If your income drops significantly during one of those two years, how will you make ends meet without the additional income from your family member's loan?\n\nUltimately, only you know what's right for you.

She's also recently in remission for breast cancer and I can't let her overwork herself since she's at risk for relapse if she gets too stressed. I feel responsible for her since she's very scatter-brained and I'm concerned that she can't make it on her own since she's never had to do so before. \nMy brother and I pay most of the bills. She gets $700 a month for unemployment, but that won't cover the debt she's gotten herself into over the years, along with two cars and a huge electricity bill.  I think I make enough to survive on my own (especially with a roommate), but I need advice about how to deal with a dependent parent.\nTL;DR: Desperately want to move out of the nest, but don't know how to keep myself and my mother financially stable. Any advice for me?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "You cannot support your mother financially while you try to start your adult life. This is something you need to accept. Your mother needs to learn financial responsibility, and right now, you being her crutch is enabling her bad habits. You should sit down with her and explain that you love her but you can't continue supporting her financially. Encourage her to seek help from a financial advisor or counselor. It may be difficult, but this is necessary for both of you to grow and become independent adults.",

So we need to talk about how you are going to find work so you can support yourself when that happens.\"\nHaving no skills is an excuse. There are unskilled jobs out there--the Twin Cities have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. And clearly she has worked before if she is on unemployment. It sounds to me like your mom has a bad case of learned helplessness, i.e. somebody has always taken care of her so she has never had to do it herself. \nAn artist type could work for a gallery or at a museum gift shop or an art supply store. Anybody can learn to run a cash register. \nSee if there are county services for assistance in finding jobs especially for older/displaced workers. \nIf you are adamant about supporting her yourself, you need substantially better income. If you have been working in apt leasing, see if there are apt management jobs where you live on premises and get an apt free or reduced rate as part of your compensation.",
        "answer_2": "What you should do is not move out until you have your college degree. You're unwilling to let your mother be evicted from her trailer, and if she's unwilling to take charge of her finances that is a very real possibility. \nYou can try to help her improve her finances, but your goal should be working on you--finishing that B.A."

        "prediction": "It's very likely that your personal information was compromised during the Target data breach. Unfortunately, this means you need to be extra vigilant with your finances until you can determine if there are any other accounts affected or if your identity has been stolen. Here are some steps you should take:\n1. Contact Chase immediately and report all of these fraudulent charges. They will help you close the current account and issue a replacement.\n2. Freeze your credit reports (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) so no one else can open an account in your name. This won't affect your ability to use existing lines of credit, but it does prevent anyone from opening new ones without your permission.\n3. Monitor your bank statements closely for any additional unauthorized activity.\n4. Consider using cash or debit instead of credit cards when possible, especially at self-pay gas stations. If someone steals your PIN number, they have direct access to your funds.\n5. Be wary of phishing scams via email or phone - criminals may try to impersonate your bank or law enforcement agencies to trick you into giving them more information. Don't click links or provide sensitive info unless you're absolutely sure who you're dealing with.",

So I'll be graduating in a few months and I'm not exactly sure what to do. I'll be able to graduate with no debt, about 20k in cash, and about 40k in investments.

Thoughts?\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As an assistant, my answer is always: it depends on your personal circumstances. Here are some points you may want to consider:\n\n1. Are you financially ready to own a home? Buying a home comes with many expenses beyond the purchase price, such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, etc. Make sure you have a solid understanding of these costs and that you can afford them.\n\n2. Do you have a good emergency fund? You should aim to have at least six months' worth of living expenses saved up before becoming a homeowner. This will help cover any unexpected expenses that come up.\n\n3. Is this the best use of your money? While investing $60k into a down payment and rental income sounds great, there are opportunity costs involved. What could you earn by keeping that money invested and continuing to save/invest?\n\n4. How is your job situation? If you're fresh out of school, are you confident in your career path and salary potential? It might be risky to tie yourself to a mortgage if you're not yet established in your field.\n\n5. Have you considered the risks of being a landlord? Being a landlord involves more than just collecting rent - you'll also need to deal with tenant issues, legal disputes, and potentially missed payments.\n\nUltimately, only you can decide whether buying a home is the right choice for you. Take the time to educate yourself on the process and weigh all the factors carefully before making a decision.",

Hi all,\nI've done all I can to reduce my living expenses to save more money and I'm doing a pretty good job with all of that. My biggest expense now is my rent -- $1200 for a studio in the hills. The place is amazing and the solitude has really inspired and created a lot of good my work/personal life.\nBut it's been over a year, and I'm ready to move on.

It is a small complex, managed by an almost retired guy on behalf of his mother who is the owner.  She's pretty old and he is set to inherit the place when she finally dies.  Since it's a family owned thing we were told at the beginning to pay rent with cash, since it was easy for them.\nWe have been excellent tenants, in general the whole complex is very quiet and polite, and we have never been late with our rent or had any problems with them.  However, we are sensing that there may be some changes coming and the ownership/management of the complex might be handed down to the next generation son, who we do not like or trust.     At all! \nNothing bad has happened yet, but two very established families suddenly moved recently and we are a little concerned about the changes we see.  \nOur lease is month to month and we have never gotten rent reciepts, as it's difficult to even pay the property manager directly and we usually end up giving the money to his sweet old mother in law who also lives there and collects all the rent money for him.\nI'm also pretty sure they don't report to credit agencies, which kind of stinks for us. \nSo having briefly explained the situation, herein lies my questions:\nHow can I protect my family in case something bad happens?  Also, how can I get proof of our rent history to submit to our credit agencies?\nI'm aware that having bank statements proving we took out rent money each month is not probably enough evidence to  prove we have been paying every month.  Is there some kind of document I can have the property manager sign that proves we have been excellent (paying on time) tenants?\nWhat's the best way to ask for such a document without raising undue concern or suspicion?\nAlso, we are located in California fyi.\nI know there's a lot of questions in here, hopefully someone has some answers or advice, or experience!

Contact a tenant rights organization in your area to understand what protections you have under California state laws. They can advise you further based on your specific circumstances.\n4.

If they won't write you a written receipt that will at least prove that you handed them the payment.\nThey may not like you recording them, but it's your responsibility to prove you paid them.

        "prediction": "Defensive stocks are meant to perform better during times of economic uncertainty or recession compared to cyclical stocks. They are not supposed to be immune from market corrections. The idea is that when the overall market drops significantly, defensive stocks will drop less than other types of stocks because their businesses are less sensitive to economic downturns. For example, people may cut back on buying luxury goods or traveling during an economic crisis, but they still need to buy groceries, pay utilities bills, and go to work at essential jobs. Therefore, companies in these industries (e.g., consumer staples, healthcare, utilities) tend to have more stable earnings and cash flows, which can help them maintain their stock prices better during a market selloff. However, even defensive stocks can experience significant price declines during severe market crises - it's just that the decline tends to be less severe than what we see with cyclical stocks.

If you do not have access to these types of accounts, then you will want to look into general investment options like mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), or stocks.\n\nInvesting is beyond the scope of this subreddit, but generally speaking, you want to start with understanding risk tolerance, time horizon, asset allocation, etc. This is where a financial advisor could come in handy. Alternatively, there are many resources online that can guide you through the process.\n\nRemember, always consult a licensed professional before making any major financial decisions.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nSelling before Dec 15 I'm relatively new to investing, but does it make sense to sell US / Chinese stocks before tariff day because maybe they will go down? I guess it is clear that the outcome will have some kind of impact, but how likely is it that the stocks go down significantly?\nThanks for your answers\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "As an investor, you should avoid making decisions based on short-term market fluctuations or events. The stock market has a long history of overreacting to news and headlines, both positive and negative. Trying to time the market by selling before a potential event like this can lead to missing out on future gains and potentially buying back in at higher prices later. Instead, focus on having a well-diversified portfolio aligned with your investment goals and time horizon. If you are unsure about whether this decision aligns with those objectives, consider consulting a financial advisor.",
        "answer_1": "Buying/Selling anything based on short term volatility isn't investing, it's speculating. There's plenty of that in the market, and people win and lose fortunes every day, speculating on volatility. If you want to be a proper investor, you should view this as noise. Where do you want to be in 10 years? Make your decisions based on long term trends.",
        "answer_2": "Entry points in your investments is a critical matter, don't listen to anyone that says otherwise. It's called risk management, anyone that says otherwise is fucking retarded. So yeah, you should be flying to safety and wait until the FOMC meeting is resolved on Dec 11 and the tariff decisions are made for Dec 15. Tariffs are prolly going to get implemented and that'll cause a dip. Fed might actually raise the rate so that will also cause a massive dip. It's pretty likely that we will see broad market pullbacks this week and early next week, which gives you a much better entry point. Finally, do your own research - don't listen to a bunch of randos on reddit."

I've been working at this current job for a little over 1.5 years now, and so far it's been going okay...\nMaxed out 401k - ~$18k/year; I also have 5k in an IRA from 2 years ago which is still with my bank and I haven't done anything with it.\nZero debt (parents paid off my school loans in 2014, and I then helped pay off parents' mortgage in 2015)\nCurrent Savings: $50k in Ally savings account, generating 1% interest.\nHome I'm looking to buy - 2 bed 2 bath condo, ~$160k\nCurrent expenditures:  ~$1095 a month on rent, ~$40/month on internet and $30/month on phone, ~$400-$500 a month on credit card (mostly for food); everything else in my paycheck I've been putting into my Savings account.\nApartment lease will be up at the end of August this year, and I'll need to have bought my home by them.  I'll be planning on putting at least a 20% down-payment - which will be taking ~$32k out of the $50k I have now.\nInterest rate won't really concern me all this much if I'm planning on paying ~$5k per month towards mortgage and principle to pay it off in 2.5 years.   I'd be putting the rest (~$1k/month) into replenishing my Savings (until I get back to at least $50k, after which, I might try my hand at that whole investing boglehead-thingys that I've read about on this subreddit).\nMy question is, is it a good idea to pursue this course of action of paying off a mortgage in 2.5-3 years?  \nThe reason I'd like be completely debt free by the time I'm 30 is because I don't know how stable my position is.  I'm fairly certain I won't be fired or laid off in the next 2-3 years.   So if I can be completely debt free, I shouldn't have to worry even if I do lose my job in 4-5 years down the line.\nOh and the reason I want a 2 bed 2 bath is because I'd like to rent out the second bedroom to someone, so it can help cover the HOA fees each month and most of the annual property tax.\nOnce I have those things covered, the only expenditures I really have to worry about are just internet and phone, and food.\nIs this a good plan for my situation, or should I be doing something more optimal in my current situation?\nUltimate goal is to reach financial independence by ~40.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "No, it's not a good idea to pay off your mortgage in such a short amount of time. Here's why:\n\n1. Opportunity cost: You could be earning significantly higher returns by investing instead of paying extra principal on your mortgage. The stock market has historically returned around 7%, while your mortgage is probably less than 4%. By focusing solely on paying off your mortgage quickly, you're missing out on potential long-term growth.\n\n2. Liquidity: Having a large chunk of money tied up in your house doesn't give you as many options as having that same money invested elsewhere. What if you want to start a business, go back to school, move across the country, etc.? With your money tied up in your house, you may not have the flexibility you need.\n\n3. Taxes: When you pay off your mortgage early, you're losing out on the tax deduction for mortgage interest. This could potentially increase your taxes owed.\n\n4. Risk: By tying up so much of your net worth in one asset (your house), you're increasing your risk level. If the housing market takes a downturn, you could find yourself in negative equity again.\n\nInstead, focus on building an emergency fund, maxing out your retirement accounts, and keeping your housing costs reasonable. Your ultimate goal of reaching financial independence by age 40 is admirable, but there are better ways to achieve it than rushing to pay off your mortgage in three years.",
        "answer_1": "Looks like a solid game plan. Keeping the mortgage is high risk, high reward - more volatility in your net worth, but with current interest rates you'd end up (on average) with a higher net worth. Perfectly fine to pay it off early.",
        "answer_2": "Are you sure you want to stay in the same neighborhood of the same city even if you lose your job?  If so, it sounds like a fine plan.  If not, then just saving a bunch gives you a big cushion of cash to get you through looking for a new job and relocating if necessary.  "

That's more than double what you might pay at a public university in your state. You will have to take out significant student loans to attend.\n\n2) For-profit institution: Full Sail is a private, for-profit university. While there are many great programs and professors there, these types of institutions often come under scrutiny due to their business model. Be sure to do plenty of research before committing.\n\n3) Employment outcomes: According to Full Sail's website, their graduates earn an average starting salary of $40k/year. This number should be taken with a grain of salt, as schools tend to inflate those figures. Additionally, employment rates vary by program. Do your own research on the specific degree you plan to pursue.\n\nGiven all of this, my advice would be to explore other options first.

Then at the end of the six months your amount is used to purchase the company\u2019s stock at 15% off of whatever the lowest price the stock had been during the period, issued to you immediately.

You should definitely take full advantage of this program.",

        "prediction": "No, you cannot make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your spouse has no earned income (i.e., doesn't work). The exception would be if she has other sources of income besides working such as self-employment or investment income.

One such example is Gary Becker, who initially opposed school integration but later changed his view based on evidence showing its positive effects. Another is Richard Thaler, whose research on behavioral economics challenged traditional economic assumptions and led him to become a leading proponent of the field. These are just two examples, but there are countless others across various areas of economics. The point is that while ideology and preconceived notions can certainly influence decision-making, good data and analysis can still lead to changes in thinking.",
        "answer_1": "I'm a research psychologist, and I sat in on a graduate-level economics course in which several inconvenient psychological truths, so to speak, were casually dismissed by the econ professor running the course. His basis for dismissal of psychological research findings was that he'd want to see a study re-run with real money (rather than hypothetical responses or probabilistic rewards), or with real people (not college students), or on a US sample (rather than European). At the same time, several of the empirical econ studies discussed in the course used a casual examination of different modal responses, absent any significance tests, to claim support for predictions. And the instructor remarked more than once (only half-jokingly) that he believed that 10% - 20% of any given sample of students was always \"off the reservation,\" acting contrary to rational predictions for entirely unpredictable reasons.\nWhile I took a lot away from that course, my confidence in empirical economics took a bit of a dive. I'd now prefer to examine the methods and analyses myself before fully embracing new economic research.

Shiller's PE for the US stock market is above 30.\nFootnote: here's some technical analysis (i.e. fancy but meaningless lines) for Shiller PE for the US stock market: [  I picked the year 1981 because that's when the USD inflation started to die and the bull market for long term bonds started.\n<|assistant|>\n",
        "prediction": "Shiller PE, also known as cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, is a valuation metric used to determine whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued in the long run. A reading of 30 or higher is generally considered high and suggests that stocks may be overpriced relative to historical averages. However, there are several reasons why you shouldn't necessarily avoid buying U.S. Stock ETFs based on this metric alone:\n\n1. Historical context: The Shiller PE has been above 30 multiple times throughout history, including during periods of strong returns. For example, it was at similar levels in the late 1990s before the tech bubble burst. This doesn't mean that another crash is imminent, just that valuations are currently high.\n\n2. Long-term perspective: While the current level of the Shiller PE is high, it's still below the all-time high of around 45 seen in the early 2000s. Additionally, stocks have historically delivered positive returns even after extended periods of high valuations.\n\n3. Diversification benefits: By investing in an ETF that tracks the entire U.S. Market, you're spreading your risk across thousands of companies rather than betting on any one individual stock. This can help mitigate the impact of any potential downturn caused by overvalued stocks.\n\nUltimately, while the Shiller PE is a useful tool for understanding valuations, it shouldn't be the only factor guiding your investment decisions. Other factors such as economic fundamentals, interest rates, and company-specific analysis should also be taken into account.",

        "question": "<|system|>\n\n<|user|>\nCredit freezes are now free. Starting today. EDIT 4:\nI'm re-arranging and cleaning up the post to show info in a clean format, so as to answer many of the questions than has been asked, because I can't answer questions timely any more, because this post blew up. But I want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. \nWhat is a credit freeze?\nA credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. It protects you against identity theft. Even if a hacker knows all your info, including your SSN, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. Now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. Once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.\nOther replies:\nWhy is this news important now?\nMany experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. Starting Friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. In the wake of a massive data breach last year at Equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million Americans, Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. Equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. [The bill was passed in May](  [It is effective as of today.]( \nHow can I do it?\nTo set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: \n[Experian]( \n[Equifax]( \n[TransUnion](  \n[ChexSystems]( \n[Innovis] ( \n[NCTUE] ( \nYou will be given a PIN that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. \nDo I have to do this with all credit agencies? I only have one credit card\nYes you do. Your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. \nDoes this mean that I can freeze my credit score at 810? Does freezing affect my score?\nNo. A credit freeze only freezes who can see your credit record. Your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. Freezing does not affect your score.\nIs credit unfreeze/thaw also free?\n[Yes.]( \nHow long does the \u201cthaw\u201d process takes before credit is available to be pulled?\nIf you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.\nWhat if I lose my PIN? How do I recover it\nFrom several posts I saw, there are methods to recover your pin/ and access your account that involves snail mail. You get letters in regular mail, which I assume is for confirming your physical address.\nHow accurate is this info?\nTo the best of my knowledge. I will update as I find better info.\nWhere can I find more info?\nOriginal Post\nEDITS:\nThanks to   ,   ,    ,   ,   ,         for their contributions.\nThanks for the gold!!! \n<|assistant|>\n",

To place a freeze, visit the websites of the three main credit bureaus - Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion - and follow the instructions provided. Be sure to keep track of your PIN, as you'll need it to lift the freeze in the future. The \"thaw\" process should take no longer than 3 hours if done online, or 1 business day via mail. If you lose your PIN, contact the bureau in question through traditional mail to verify your identity and regain access.",

So I'll have my raise + 1.3k per month to spend, most of which I plan to save as I want to purchase a home in the next 5 years or so. I'm on a 6 figure salary and my calculations tell me that if I get my raise and save an extra 1k for the next 3 years or so, I'll have enough money to pay for a downpayment.\nAnyways, my company has graciously allowed me to transfer to their NJ branch, and I'll be needing a car to live + commute to work. (They have free parking)\nI was thinking about leasing the cheapest car around (probably a Corolla / Elantra / Sentra) to save money for the house. I know how this sub feels about leasing, but to be honest I want a higher end car going into my 30's so this car will act as a gap car in order to save for my house, and then I'll be financing a higher end car. The lease would end up being around 350~400 a month with insurance.\nHowever, my friend has this 2005 BMW he never uses so he offered to sell it to me for 2.5k (I think it's worth like 4k or something right now - dealer offered 3k to him) So this will obviously be cheaper since it will be less than 100 a month for 3 years + 100 ish insurance since this is an owned car.
