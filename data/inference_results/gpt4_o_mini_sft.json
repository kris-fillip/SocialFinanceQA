However, I think they are misclassifying me because\n\nThey have me work in the office and they tell me the times I should be there \nThey supervise me and tell me how or what I should do. \n\nThey give me \"projects\" to make it seem like I'm a contractor, but I still dont' think it is.\nMy dilemma is, I like this company. I like the people. I like the work. They pay me $15 an hour as an independent contractor which at the end comes out to basically $10.50 which is minimum wage in California. \nI see other companies that are offering $18, but they are classified as employees and receive benefits such as insurance and PTO. \nMy options?:\n\nAsk the current company for $22 an hour because I enjoy being there\nStay at the current company until I find another job and then leave\n",

        "question": "ELI5: Why do banks lend at such a low rate for mortgages? On PF we often talk about earning 7% on stocks, or 5% on bonds in the long run. If bonds for example are a fairly safe investment, why would any lender bother to sell a mortgage that only earns say 3.125%, when they could invest it somewhere else for a higher return? Especially once you consider that mortgages have some overhead (paying loan officers, accounting systems, advertising, etc) and significant risk of default.\nObviously lenders aren't idiots, so how do they make a good return lending at such low rates?",
        "prediction": "Because it is the easiest thing in the world to sell - no one else sees mortgages as a sure thing like banks do.\nWhen you loan someone money, you are betting on someone being able to pay the money back according to a set schedule. Defaulting on the loan is like losing a bet - the loan been accounted for and needs a new valuation.\nA house? Houses can be quickly converted into cash, no questions asked, and that makes it a winner.\nSo, if someone asks for a mortgage, that person has to bet on them just losing their job or their house burning down. That is an insurance policy priced and paid by a single, set amount and a one-time, reduced payout to index for time-value.\nExtra: it's often easier to have more collateral than less. You could make a better return buying one car vs buying twice as many cars (larger bet) because of it being more liquid and so on.",
        "answer_1": "Several reasons:\n\nTheir cost of funding is very low (e.g. savings account interest)\nThey invest with scale (many mortgages/c&i loans/credit card/etc.)\nThe loans are secured by the property \nThe risk of investing in the equity markets is much, much higher than secured lending\nIn many cases they do not even hold the mortgages, merely package them for the government (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie) to securitize and sell to investors  \n",
        "answer_2": "There is a huge secondary market for mortgages. So the bank that lends you the money for your home can turn around and resell that mortgage to GNMA or FNMA (or others). They can then keep a small amount of the percentage going past (say .125%) and the risk of holding the note now belongs to someone else. And GNMA can repackage and sell the mortgages bundled into bonds that pay 3%. "

        "question": "Just had about $800 worth of stolen out of my parents garage, is it worth claiming? Simple question probably but I don't know what to do in this situation. They just had a few things stolen and after talking to the neighbors, they have also had stuff stolen and they all ended up being some sort of metal. So first we called scrap and salvage yards in our area to see if anything would come up and still waiting on confirmation from that. We have a $500 deductible and I was just wondering if anyone knew how much this would affect the insurance rate if we made the claim. Sorry for probably a stupid question but I just have no experience with this and my parents won't really talk to me about it saying it isn't my responsibility to help but I just want to know how it all works. Thanks pf\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who responded so quickly. I pay my own car insurance but I've never had to make a claim so I wasn't sure how it all worked so thanks for information and advice. I wish my parents could have just explained it to me instead of having to come on to the internet to get advice and info but thanks again everyone.",
        "prediction": "Well, it comes down to how much you believe there's a fair chance of getting it back. The police are unlikely to do anything if its small $ enclosed (like $20 and indexable documents). But to make a claim vs a $500 deductible you are going to have to work out an actual price which is conveyable to an insurer (largely 'non functional' it is as) and so on. I could spend 20-30 hours to prove to an insurance company ripped off off my $30 USB drive, in trying to prove I owned it as even if I have documented consumption, they will get ornery until I locate the e-mail acknowledgement of the purchase which means no matter what you do if you can't beproved $ if there isn't a receipt around. Sometimes, proving that is a real bother, sometimes it isn't... and whether it's worth it to you, I can't tell you.\nIf anything you can find (like prices from ads on similar stuff, etc on the interweb), is going to be fair reimbursement. The insurance company will ask you for tracks that leads to a reliable proof of ownership... these are time patterns, etc.",
        "answer_1": "So you're weighing possible insurance increase in the amount of thousands paid over time... or a cost of $300 (since the deductible is $500 and that comes out of your pocket as well). I would replace anything if needed and beef up security for your garage/home.",
        "answer_2": "Probably not worth it to file an insurance claim, but definitely file a police report.  If anything had a serial number, the cops will be able to search for that if the item is ever found.  Would mean additional charges on the thief, which would be worth it."

        "question": "Should I cancel my whole life policy My parents bought a whole life insurance policy when I was born and transferred it to me a while back. I have been paying the premiums but I recently read a few posts here about how it may not be worth it. Here is the info I have on the policy, I would appreciate your input. Thank you.\n$25,000 whole life policy with Security Benefit Life Insurance with options every 5 years to increase coverage (10k I believe).\nPremiums: $8.50/month\nCurrent policy value if I cash out: $850\nReduced paid-up insurance (whatever that means): $13,000 \nI am 28, married, 1 child, and I have sufficient term life insurance through my employer. I have a pre-existing condition that might make it hard to get life insurance later on, but it shouldn't affect my lifespan.",
        "prediction": "You need an insurance policy to cover your entire life, not just until term life insurance runs out. Where would someone stand today if they waded through life thinking they didn't need insurance because \"I have until my term insurance runs out\" only to be diagnosed with a serious illness and no longer covered?\nLiving benefits riders are very valuable and should be included in insurance policies.",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the life insurance industry. Under no circumstances do you cancel that policy before you have another in place, even if you have term through work. Most new policies have a \"contestability period\" where if you pass away, your family can receive only the premiums paid into the policy depending on how you died. After the contestability period ends, the insurance company has to pay the insurance value of the policy.\nWhole life is meant to cover solely funeral expenses, something your family will have to pay for no matter how long you live. Term is meant to cover short term needs like income replacement, mortgage, child care expenses if your wife has to go back to work if you die unexpectedly, etc. \nPaid-up insurance means you are guaranteed $12,000 of life insurance for the rest of your life in exchange for forfeiting the $800+ cash you would get if you cancelled the policy. And you wouldn't have to pay another dime. I would love to see a modern day policy where you can get $12,000 future money for your family in exchange for paying $800 now. It doesn't exist for a 28yr old with a pre-existing condition. \nThe other wonderful thing about paid-up policies, especially the older ones (you'll have to check the way the policy itself is written) is that after a certain number of years they often start earning cash value again. Pretty much the insurance company takes that $800 cash value, reinvests it, and it makes them money. The old policies \"rewarded\" the policy holder for that by paying interest(dividends) back onto the policy in the form of additional cash value. Which you can then use to increase the insurance value of the policy if you choose to. \nYours isn't old enough to work quite as well as this example, but I've seen policies that were originally bought to cover maybe $500 or so, the policy holder paid about $50 in premiums before the policy became fully paid, and when they finally passed, their family got a few thousand dollars. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you pay more attention to the growth, that's approximately a 4000% growth on the original premiums. \nIf your patient and maintain a whole life policy correctly, especially one that was taken out when you were a child, those things can pay back a lot of extra money when you pass than what was originally paid into them in premiums. \nMy recommendation is to find someone who can walk you though all the specific options of your policy. If it is an insurance agent, make it extremely clear that you have no interest in exchanging it for a new policy (even if you are thinking about it in real life), you just want to understand how it works and your different options. A lot of insurance agents still work on commission, so do not let one of them try to pressure you into cashing it out in favor of a brand new policy. Not all of them are like that, but there are some that only care about their sales goals and not what's best for you and your family. ",
        "answer_2": "Why not go to an investment advisor and ask for a free comparison? Most advisors are also in the insurance business or have a business partner who is...\nFor that matter, why not go to a second advisor after that? Compare notes on what they can do for you and think about it. \nRemember that new life insurance has a \"free look\" window, so you can keep the old whole life policy for a little while, as you consider you're options. I, for one, would tell you to keep your current policy as is, but an advisors job is to gather all the pertinent questions and give you a straight answer.\nOne important question: Have you considered family insurance?"

I spend about 60-80 dollars in gas a week, 150 on our mobile bill, about 100 on groceries a week (higher than actual, just being conservative), plus gym, Netflix, etc. we eat out maybe slightly more often than others at 2-3 times a week, but meal prep all our breakfast and lunch for work.\nShe makes 1459 every two weeks, has a newer car payment of 262 a month, plus 37000 in student loans that she pays at 560 a month minimum (normally higher), and has various other expenses but I\u2019m not sure the exact amounts, but mostly small.\nI have 30,000 in savings for a house and 12000 in emergency savings currently. She has 9000 in emergency savings.\nIt\u2019s tough for me to understand how much house we can afford comfortably, that would allow us to still save at a decent clip or allow us to continue our current lifestyle (which isn\u2019t lavish by any means). I initially told our realtor that we have a limit at 275,000 but recently have been feeling like we can go higher and still be comfortable while saving money. \nI was hoping you fine folks here could help me figure out that range? Right now we are looking at a house that ticks all our boxes at 335000 but think they will take lower.\nOh also, we have a wedding coming up in March of 2019 that has current obligations totaling 12000 remaining.",
        "prediction": "267,000 (monthly payments of $1300)\n275,000 (monthly payments of $1331)\n285,000 (monthly payments of $1381)\n295,000 (monthly payments of $1433)\n305,000 (monthly payments of $1485)\n320,000 (monthly payments of $1566)\n330,000 (monthly payments of $1616)\n340,000 (monthly payments of $1667)\n350,000 (monthly payments of $1718)\nAnd last but not least...\n360,000 (monthly payments of 1769)",
        "answer_1": "typical rule is 3-4x combined annual income. so the house would be in that range. But the term being able to \"afford\" something varies so much case to case. Really depends on your lifestyle decisions. Are you guys paying for the wedding? It doesn't seem like you have 20% saved for a down payment on that house, so you are going to incur PMI?",
        "answer_2": "Its important to understand the true costs of that 335k house. As someone who just bought a house in a similar range, all the online estimators are wrong, but its easy to get a better estimate.\nMake sure you understand how much homeowners insurance will be. Its very possibly higher than you think.\nMake sure you understand how much taxes will be. Your county has an online tax estimator. Don't look at historical tax payments as florida's \"save our homes\" law prevents them from going up until the house is sold. \nUsing orange county's tax estimator it looks like your taxes will be 4500-5500$ per year with homestead exemption.\nBetween homeowners, taxes, and PMI, you are looking at roughly 600-800$ more per month on top of the mortgage.\nAlso make sure you understand the total amount of money you will need to bring to the table for closing costs (this includes not just the downpayment and loans fees etc but also the money you need to put into escrow which is a significant amount of money. If orlando market is anything like South FL its competitive enough at the 300-350 range that many sellers aren't willing to pay closing."

I think it's easy to say \"pay down every dollar of CC debt, then save for downpayment,\" and while that's generally sound advice, I'd like to get a home ASAP.\nI'd like everyone's opinion on aggressively paying down the cards to a lower utilization (currently at 52%), and then saving up for 20% down on a home. Once the home is purchased, I could resume knocking down the CC balances. \nBasically, what's an ideal credit utilization before entering a home-buying process? 15%? 10? 0?\nI'm open to answering any and all questions.",

Ideally, I would get my DTI below 30/36% before starting to classify my expenses. \nBy improving your DTI by paying off the debt, your mortgage can be lower and/or you will be able to qualify for a mortgage that previously had been too high for you to justify to your underwriter. \nThis will vary mortgage company by company.

        "question": "Company Suspended 401k. What now? I was just informed that my company will be suspending our 401(k) effective immediately for a certain number of people designated as \"highly compensated employees\". Apparently they are not meeting IRS requirements for participation among employees earning <$120k per year. They said they risk losing their tax-advantaged status, and my plan will suspended until they come out with a strategy and more details in a couple weeks. So I'm losing out on contributing, and my employer match for an undetermined amount of time.\nSo: \n1) Can they do this?

Management is probably spending a lot of time trying to fix it, and making mistakes just complicates things further. Keep this in mind though: if they keep this suspended for too long, they may not have a plan that, by definition and by reality, can be classified as a \"401k\" any longer. So for many non-highly compensated employees, this may lead to having to wait many years, many times up to 6 years, before the situation is made right. At which point, a lot of people may be on better retirement plan benefits elsewhere and may not want to come back.\nOh, and don't YOLO on AMD calls.

When too much of the total plan participation is owned by the company's top earners it is called a \"top-heavy plan\" and loses IRS tax advantages unless the company makes a correction. Based on what you put in your post, I'm wagering that an end of year audit revealed that the plan is top-heavy and now the company is taking steps to correct this imbalance.\nWhat it ultimately amounts to, is that your fellow colleagues that earn less than you are not participating in the 401k as much as you and your fellow high-earners. Without knowing more about your specific income I can't recommend any specific actions, but if you can contribute to an IRA for 2017 right now is a good time to do so.\nQuestions to ask your employer benefits administrator: Was this change due to the plan becoming top-heavy? Will the company be making direct contributions for the non-highly compensated employees to bring total participation into compliance? Will the company be looking at other options to increase plan participation among lower level employees, such as increased matching rates, company-wide performance bonuses, or a broad look at increasing compensation for lower income employees?",

        "prediction": "If your wife is going to pursue a Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program through a 501(3) nonprofit, I\u2019d highly recommend speaking to a financial planner looking to help you pick a cheaper work location. The cost of rent in Seattle is crushing. The PSLF would be 120 months long, and is based off of a reasonable payment based payment plan (IBR long enough to forgive). With that high rent cost, it would take less than 5k/month after tax income to qualify for the capped monthly payment for both of you. That sound doable? \nOr you can the 10 year forgiveness, which basically means you have to live at least 70% of your working intern years in high cost cities (Seattle, San Francisco, New York City, LA) to get forgiveness over the 10 year period. (IDR capped monthly payment + work?)\nBut to answer your question, there is a good chance if you file jointly her monthly payment will rise. But it\u2019s a means tested payment plan. It\u2019s calculated based in adjusted disposable income. If you make a lot more than her, it could result in a payment update (higher), but not double. Softer means testing would make it based on discretionary income, to solarize everyone would not qualify. Illustrative example: $160k household income filing jointly with no children is billed $139.87 with PSLF standard plan. Without the PSLF, payments (Bartlett IRS) would be $1,652.58/month under new repayment plan for income driven repayment. Ssome cannot pay that high mangabyte 2 incomes, so it is means tested and caps debt to income consideration of a household on the most common IDR plan. \nAsk her to check if there is a NJCLS program in her area, the best source for PSLF lawyers. This program pumps out associates and helps her be connected to financial planners and lawyers that pursue PSLS under Public Service Lawyer middleslister type jobs for the most likely to get forgiven associates. \nIDR and bankruptcy in the first year would be a good combo plan. MCC with PSLF and IDR cap are possibilities, or I don\u2019t know what job, what PSLF or state earned credit t for the plan, or if she was paying under her base minimum payment for income driven repayment at $320, the math could change monthly based on tax filings. \nHate to spend others spec money, but if she is the sole earner and filing separately (taxpayers have to use SFS if married), cheapest work locations for new lawyers, 1-2 income household, and want to stay married, Omaha, Nebraska. St Charles, Missouri also. Justice in the mecca cities is unattainable on $40-70kish. Idealistic, but need to eat and stay warm. Best of luck blessed 2018 filers.",

My wife and I file jointly, because it's easier, and we would rather pay less in taxes and knock more off the student loan than pay more taxes and sit on a larger loan balance.\nI think a big consideration is whether you as a couple expect to pay off her debt, or ride out the 20 years on income-based repayment (I'm assuming it's not a 10 year public service situation).  If you expect to pay off her debt, better to pay fewer taxes and knock down that balance with higher payments, probably in excess of the minimums even based on your combined salary, when possible.  If you expect to just eeke out the 20 years of income-based payments, I guess it could be advantageous to pay more taxes and less on the loans, though the payments will increase as her salary does anyway, as will the lost tax advantage.  \nAs a side note, turns out having a kid can drastically reduce the income-based payment amount, though it certainly does not improve your overall financial outlook :-)",

        "question": "Appropriate Salary Paycut/Salary Negotiation I'm relocating to a city that pays on average 20% lower than my current city (research done on glassdoor, robert half, etc.). Based on my calculations, I may have to accept an offer that's $20,000 less than what I make now (currently make around 90K and the median salary for my position is 70K). Although the cost of living in the new city is much lower, to retain the same amount of savings that I have now, I can only take a $10,000 pay cut. I don't have kids, and I really don't have that many expenses outside of college debt. However, I'm trying to save to start my own business in a couple of years. \nThe hiring manager has asked whether we can discuss over email or phone about my salary expectations. My plan was to say what my current salary is, but I understand there is a pay difference between the two cities. I am open to considering the entire compensation package in regards to PTO, potential bonuses, and future growth.\nWhat do you guys think? Are there additional negotiating tactics I should use?

        "question": "Is there a point in negotiating with insurance company if I have GAP insurance on a total car? I got into a wreck last week and my insurance company said it's totalled. I owe about $4,500 on it and I don't imagine the car itself is worth that (2002 Honda CR-V). I looked around and it might be worth $3,500-$4,000. We did get GAP insurance for it when we got it and my wife insists there's a point in negotiating a higher payout from the insurance even though we have GAP (she says that if we have to use GAP to pay the rest off, we won't get anything for a down payment on another car). Is there a point? Is there a way I can combine them to get enough on a down payment for another car?\nBonus question: Anyone have tips on how to negotiate with insurance companies for a higher payout? This is my first time dealing with insurance companies to this extent and I feel like I don't know what I'm doing.",

If it\u2019s November of last year premium and your state values vehicles this way then you would be at \u201c0\u201d because that\u2019s how they set it up to work. Or some states have index value of 14 to 15. So if the claim is taken before the 14 month and got an index value of 15 then your vehicle would look like it\u2019s already over 14%. Please understand the GAP company is going to get paid first. Than depending on your State The insurance is ripped for the remaining amount. Or you he\u2019ll trying to squeeze insurance.",

So there's no point in negotiating unless you can get the insurance payout to be MORE than you owe on the car WITHOUT the gap insurance.\nIf you owe $4500 on a car worth $4000 and it's totaled, you will get a payout of $0.  All gap insurance does is prevent you from still having to pay that last $500 on a car that no longer exists.  The hard truth is that you have no equity in your car for the insurance company to pay out.",
        "answer_2": "If you can get your insurance to pay more than $4500, you keep the extra and can use it as a down payment.  If your insurance pays $4500 or less, gap will make up the difference but you won't have any extra for a downpayment.\nOdds are if your car is worth $3500-4000 you are unlikely to be able to negotiate a settlement of over $4500.  But wait and see what their offer is, if they come in higher than expected you might be able to get a few hundred."

First, the company deleted all of its Twitter and Facebook posts from its respective accounts. Additionally, there has been radio silence from a PR perspective. Second, company leadership recently sold shares and declared it via SEC form 4's -- apparently done for tax purposes, but it is believed that these may have been vested shares. Lastly, the company filed an 8-K today which sold preferred stock which could imply the company is selling convertible debt.

Recently, I got an email from their new business department head asking to chat. We talked for a bit, and he mentioned that they're starting a brand-new MBA program in the Fall, and personally invited me to attend. I applied, was accepted, and the effective cost is $0 for the entire MBA, which is done on a part-time schedule and should take 2-3 years to complete.\nI've wanted to get an MBA, but my situation restricts my options heavily (my wife is a teacher and is not going to move for me to attend a top 10, if I could even get in- my GMAT was a 660).\nThere's a lot of discussion about the ROI of an MBA, but it's difficult to quantify it when the cost is $0. In my opinion, getting the MBA is more about the achievement factor than anything else, but there's obvious risk in getting an MBA from a program that has 0 graduates (as it's new).\nI work for a major bank in Pennsylvania and do not plan on moving for the foreseeable future, probably at least 3-4 years ahead until my wife is tenured in the PA Education system and we can move together. My boss and his boss are both supportive of my plans to get an MBA, and I'll continue in my current role with no adjustments.\nI guess my question now is, should I do it?

While we enjoy the monthly cash-flow from the duplex we are interested in buying distressed property (both SFR and Multi) and fixing it up, then reselling.  \nWe could probably gather about 100K in seed money, which I see as enough to place the 25% down on the first property, 10-20K in reno, and a large contingency fund.  I have pretty much any tools I will need and a respectable network of contractors I trust as well as a talented home inspector.\nMy question is how are these things usually structured?  LLC?

Why is that? I would expect them to show the price declining over time and being at a relative low point. \nDoes this mean nothing since share price can sometimes be manipulated by companies (splits, buybacks etc) and become an inaccurate indicator of company performance? or does it have to do with the ETFs still being listed under the NYSE and somehow being affected by the U.S.?",

        "answer_1": "Bear in mind your mortgage is only a portion of your home expenses. Your Principle, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI) is a better estimation of home expenses. And then comes maintenance (a good rule of thumb is 1% of your home's cost per year averaged out over many years). \nLenders will potentially lend up to 50% of your gross for your PITI plus other debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans, etc). Some exceptions for even higher numbers. Some lenders will cut you off in the 43-45. You will also hear terms like front end and back end rations. The former deals with just the PITI while the latter considers all debt. For just your PITI, often cited numbers are 28% and 35%, or even 1/3rd. And then you have those who recommend you budget based on net income (usually 25% of net for the very conservative recommendations). \nSo should you go with 35% or more of your gross or 25% of your net? The answer really depends on your budget. Going over 25-30% of your gross will hurt your ability to save or spend elsewhere. But at the end of the day, the amount you can afford is determined by your spending habits. If you like to spend a lot on hobbies or vacations, 25% of your net may be too high. If you never go out, never go on vacation, and never spend, then maybe numbers beyond 35% of your gross make sense. \nThe short answer? Don't go over 25-30% of your gross on PITI without being absolutely sure it fits within your budget and is in line with your financial goals. Any number below 25-30% of your gross is probably fine if it fits your budget.",
        "answer_2": "Here are the things you should add up when you're considering a mortgage:\n\nMortgage Base Payment\nMonthly tax on your home\nInsurance monthly cost\nHOA Fees\nUtilities (Heating/Cooling, Gas, Electricity, Water, Internet etc.)\n\nIf you want to be living comfortably, I personally believe that all that added shouldn't exceed 30-35% of your total Gross monthly income. Now some people push it and say it should be 30-35% after income tax is cut however that might be pushing it. In some cases, it might be even closer to 40% however the move above you go, the more you have to worry about being pushed towards the edge. I wouldn't recommend it go over 40% because you'll be squeezing your retirement funds because of it. So ideally try keeping it below 30-35% of your total gross income and I think most folks will be fine."

While my parents have been generous in allowing me to stay rent-free, and paying for my community college classes (I've been taking classes part-time since high school, I have roughly 2 full semesters under my belt), we don't get along great, and I really don't like where I live (Northern VA).  My plan is to move to the Denver, Colorado area within the next few months, after this semester finishes up in May.  I have an offer for an $18 an hour position doing the same job I'm doing now.

I have yet to discuss selling it with them, but I'm operating under the assumption that they would in turn want half of the money I get from selling it.

I've been looking online for a while, and I'll probably be able to find one for not more than 5 or 6 thousand dollars.

Below is a rough plan I've come up with for where all that will go:\nRent: (up to) $700\nFood: $250\nCar Insurance: $150\nPhone: $50\nGas: $300 (I plan on spending most of my free time hiking and exploring the state, so I'm putting in a very high estimate)\nSavings: $500\nSpending money: $500\nI plan on using my savings for unforeseen expenses like car repairs or a broken phone.  My parents are currently paying for my phone and my car insurance, and they might be willing to continue to do so.  However, I'm not counting on it.  If they're willing to, that would be an extra $200/mo going to savings.  I'm going to be on my mother's health insurance plan until I'm 26.\nSo is this realistic? I've ran the numbers over and over, and I really do think it'll be feasible.  I know that a lot of the numbers I've provided are estimates, but I've done my best to make conservative ones.

As of now I'm saving 20% of my income.\nNo other debt.\nI am 22 years old, single, with no dependents and no major health complications\nMy savings are primarily intended for living expenses during the medical procedure (will require 3 months down time where I will not be able to work)\nI thought this was the most appropriate subreddit for this question.

I have thought over this for a long time. I have decided to do it. I am here for strictly financial advice.\nSuggestions I have gotten:\nDo it in a foreign country, as long as you can trust the provider and it has a reputation for quality care.\nBenefits of US surgery: I can work during rehab.\nNegotiate it down.\nStill need to know: What loan options will I have? My only \"assets\" are my $30,000 in savings.",
        "prediction": "If your income is low in relation to your debt to income ratio I would expect interest rates of around 10% if the $120k isn't secured by anything. Sometimes, but not always, unsecured medical loans can be guaranteed by income alone. As a homeowner or borrower looking to refinance these rates are easy to get. \nI wouldn't complicate it with other programs without a full looking at all aspects of your income, assets, and the full scope of the medical procedure. The plastic surgery loan game is fairly new these days and is highly predatory. If the bank can't save you money as long as you have excellent credit you have to do a brave and terrible thing by putting out your credit and savings up against your compulsive and deeply emotional decision and ask a bank to soundly judge you. They will disapprove at best or mock you at worst because it's allowed. \nIt's trespassing for someone else to write on your body. It's not intended to have an audience. ",

I diagnosed myself but didnt had to go in to get a prescription.  I told the physician assistant what I thought, she nodded, wrote me a prescription...and I got a 120 dollar bill (after insurance).  \nI've seen everything else pretty much approved for insurance - elective gastric bypass, even friggin breast augmentation.",

        "question": "Being debt free finally feels real I am a long time reader first time poster. Would like to thank the community for all the wonderful information and inspiration. Some of the stories really kept me going.\nBackground:\nMale 34 not married.\nFriends thought i was weird for going on this journey.\nPaid off approximately 60K over 4 years (student loan, car, credit card, family loan). \nIncome was approximately $65K before tax.\nHave fully funded emergency fund of 6 months.\nContributing 15% to 401k.\nOpened and full funded a Roth this year. :)\nStarting to save for a house down payment.\nI used the Dave Ramsey method for the most part but I chose to save up a fully funded emergency fund before finishing off my last debt. Which was a loan from my family that I continued paying off monthly. The company i was working for at the time was not very stable so I put a higher value on having cash in the bank vs being debt free. \nOn Sept 2nd 2015 i finally felt safe enough to pay off the last 8K of debt. Hell Ya I am debt free. :) At this point I raised my 401K contributions to 15% from 6% as recommended.\nSo, the strange part for me was that I really did not feel very different after being officially deft free. I still feel very conservative with money and guilty about eating out or buying something nice for myself.\nOne of the things I wanted to do when I finished my journey was to give the Total Money Makeover book or FPU to those who could use it and showed interest.  I am excited to report that on Tuesday I gifted my first copy of the book to a friend who is a single mother working multiple jobs and still struggling with her finances.  After giving her the book for some reason it really hit me that I was debt free and also had a positive net-worth!  \nWhen I got home that night I logged into Vanguard and funded the remainder of my Roth  and opened a taxable account so I can start investing part of my future pay. Still trying to decide on how I want to celebrate. ;)\nDo you have any advice about being less conservative with money after becoming debt free? I still plan to keep a budget and saving, but I want to be less strict with myself.\nDo you have an interesting story about the moment when it finally clicked in your mind that you were debt free?",

Any suggestions will be appreciated.\nMy mother was let go from her job at CVS in late March of 2000. She received a check from her FutureFund 401k for around $17,000. She went to the local back and opened an IRA. Fast forward 17 years and as life has slowed down around her, she noticed she hadn't got a statement on that account for some time. After going to the bank, they had no record of the deposit or the IRA.\nObviously this was unsettling, combine that with the fact that it was 17 years ago and that my mom has to prove she deposited the money. My mother even remembered the teller that set it up for her, dates, and times. It was literally the most money she had ever had.\nThe first place we looked for help was FutureFund. I got a hold of an advisor and explained the situation. Since mom hadn't worked there in sometime, she wasn't in there system and we couldn't create an account for her. Their records don't go back that far, so they referred us to the IRS.\nThe IRS is incredibly hard to get ahold of, but we finally got an advisor. Their records only go back 10 or so years and they referred us to the Social Security office. The Social Security office advisor couldn't help, but thought if we came in and filled out some paperwork, (and paid the fees involved) that we might be able to get some sort of information about the deposit.\nI really don't know what to do now or how to get a copy of the check that was deposited in the bank.

In the email she reiterated that prior approval hasn't been necessary in years past.  Luckily, I was able to get the conference refunded but am on the hook for 50% of the lodging accommodations (strict cancellation policy). I tried to communicate to my leadership that I booked lodging accommodations prior to today for a conference in March.

        "answer_2": "Yes you absolutely should. SDCCU blows away every other bank I've ever used. The only time I've used another bank is when they offered me $300 or $500 to open up an account with them for a minimum of 3 months (Wamu did this, and Chase did this). So I did, then closed the account. I made $800 that way and they've learned their lesson.\nSDCCU isn't profit driven in the sense that all on paper profit is used to keep customer rates artificially low or expand their business - none of it is paid out to investors because there are none. They actually had the best brick-and-mortar mortgage terms every time I've financed and refinanced. Wells Fargo matched SDCCU except they tacked on $5K in closing fees for fictional things with fancy names - which SDCCU charged \"zero\" for. Other banks were even worse.\nThe only better choices for a mortgage/refi were online banks, where you take on a bit of risk because they can be flaky and can't be easily contacted for a problem (co-worker had his payments bounce with an online bank because the servicer changed mailing address and didn't even tell him, costing him real money and time).\nThe only disadvantage I ran into is SDCCU charged more for international wire transfer fees, than my wife's bank, which is not something most people will run into. But my wife's bank more than compensated by other shenanigans not unlike the Wells Fargo scandal.\nSDCCU does not do any of the BS Wells Fargo does. I have never had to speak to a single SDCCU employee about my money except when I initiated contact about something I wanted, and not a single change has ever happened to my accounts without my asking for it. They have never made a single mistake with my accounts, in 14 years.\nAlso, their employees are great. I have never felt any sales pressure from them. In fact, I've always felt their sales members were not aggressive enough. Always polite in informing me that my pre-approval has now expired just let them know if I want to try again some time. Very laid back.\nA world of difference with my wife's bank (first BoA, then Citi). Lots of WTF moments of getting new accounts we never asked for, getting screwed on rates on auto-renewal, etc.. I had to personally call them every 9 months to put my wife's money stored in CDs back into one of a higher rate because they will always auto-renew into the shittiest rate possible.

Also do paying my cable,electric,gas,insurance,etc on time increase my credit score?\nThanks.",
        "prediction": "Keep in mind, the only thing that constitutes credit is credit used. You're allowed to build as much credit as you want, your credit card company takes a wager against the bank to support your purchases. Rise is a new company willing to back your landlord, every month you pay this company, they pay the landlord on your behalf. In the next month they take your payments and pass it on to one of the credit bureaus. They want to see a steady stream of on-time payments. Your credit is a guess the future, past performance just gives a little leeway to the guess.\nDown to your question, paying bills been reported to the bureaus will show on you report, so long as the agreement authorized they report it. If you use different providers, they may decide to report bills, but most won't because they aren't in the business of making you happy, they're in the business of making money.",
        "answer_1": "It doesn't. It's obvious once you think about it, but credit scores are based on credit, or extending people money. Landlords don't lend you money, so even if your landlord was a big corporation which leased rooms and you paid by certified checks, it wouldn't help your credit.\nAs noted, it can hurt your score if you miss a utility payment - I suppose the reasoning is if you can miss a utility payment, you might miss a credit/loan payment as well.",

Why is the trading account a safe haven? Just that much harder to access for them? They don't see it? Just curious why this is so.",
        "prediction": "\nThey don't see it?\n\nI mean, in the case of your bank account they likely don't see it either until they are informed.\nThey do go after your funds regardless of how you earned them. Investing in the stock market is not special. In the case of most types of debt a judge will grant you a garnishment of payments if the creditors can show that you have the ability to pay but they don't get their money. A business/creditor will also typically classify those payments from you on their books as \"accounts receivable\" (money owed to them from individuals and businesses) but they don't set up a \"lien\" on your funds similar to how a mortgage to buy a house \"requires\" that you mortgage itself is \"held by a lien\" so the original seller can reclaim the house in some other circumstances if you stop paying it.\nAs long as your funds are going to some kind of an account under your name where there is already a legal agreement that the owner of that account has to \"give up ownership of that money\" in the documented event of a garnishment your funds are not in a protected place unless local laws say they should be. So you can take out a big loan and if you have a job you can be asked to pay back a big percent of it from your earnings to make good on your debt or, as you mentioned, your funds can be seized. (Where you complicate that is with a proper money laundering looking obfuscation to hide what funds were protected, the identity of the buyer, tracks that money did not enter a protected fund... these are time patterns that can be a little hard to build.)\nAlso, as long as you are legally running that trading account to begin with and not using it to facilitate any other illegal activity, you have \"earned the right\" for whatever specific exemptions your local jurisdiction allows regarding how much garnishment the judge can order from any of your earnings and this allowed limit can vary widely from place to place. And unlike garnishments from wages where that limit can also vary from state to state, garnishments relating to other assets like bank accounts and trading accounts are never capped on that side of things. For example your county might say the maximum amount they can take from the first $100 that you earn each month in a trading account and the first $100 of each pay check because your income is so low but not much after that. This way people that make minimum wage can have some money to pay for food instead of their creditors being allowed to take it all for to pay off business expenes.\nIf something comes in and brings then above that level then it doesn't really matter what level you are sitting at with your \"exemptions\". If for example your payments (Bart Dirks) are below those levels but the repossession/tort payment/cc payment ends up involving a class of payments that included some unknowingly 2nd hand laundering of whatever the company bought (and thus an existing gain) your gaining will most likely not be protected unless that garnishment of the payment itself is specifically of such a nature. And a business owner can demand that you show them all your business expenses when there is a court ruling against you so they can verify what are greedy business owners gaming the system versus someone that was actually just the \"responsible manager of a company\" that all happened to go south leaving no individuals in the company able to be tracked with money to pay.\n&x200B\nSimilar garish relevancy factors apply in all sorts of abnormal jurisdictional scenarios like for example when garnishment for child support comes into play. And any situation where gambling debt at a casino lets the casino have better rights over your other sources of income while they try to collect specficically on that gambling debt that you owe. \n&x200B\nAttempting to use funds won in ill legal activities in an investment account can be real tricky and you are right that under most circumstances with \"normal\" types of investments they are not protected from your creditor in the same way as your bank accounts. So in that sense they could be seen as \"easy\" to go after because the cost of tracing them to grab them is almost nothing and they almost never will be so intertwined with the individual that one might be able to claim statutory protection level \"exempt assets\" as not being just their \"investment\". A lots of connections and transactions at that stage of an investment eliminate that individual claim and just the fact that both an investment vehicle and the investment itself have a fluidly translatable monetary value makes it hard to separate them. But as long as it is clean money they came from the product created by your business until that lien is called,,, not always visit. It would just be a tricky accounting case isn't all.\nPersonal as an individual GME trading example, if I went up .85% on my investment while the guy on the other side of the aisle went up .70% on their investment \"made",
        "answer_1": "Well 401ks are exempt from most forms of garnishment [by law](  so that's pretty much all there is to it. Debt collectors would be in deep shit if they tried. Not all investment accounts are qualified retirement accounts under that law though, so if you did have money in a taxable brokerage account they could go after it. \nI'm not sure exactly what the philosophy is but I assume it's that retirement income in old age is intended to be exempt so people can actually retire safely at some point. Same basic reason social security income is exempt.",
        "answer_2": "It does seem crazy that you can put your money into one account (retirement) that is legally protected against bankruptcy or collection agencies while other accounts are not. \nI believe the logic behind the law is that if the credit card companies could wipe out consumers retirement funds, there would be a lot more people on government assistance when they are too old to work.   The law that prevents credit card companies from raiding someone's retirement fund also acts as a safety net for those that get themselves in trouble with debt.\nIt does seem morally wrong that someone could declare bankruptcy and wipe out the debt that they owe while holding onto large sums of money in a retirement account, but then you consider what the lenders are doing.  \nLending companies have become more and more predatory.  In the past lenders used to focus on being paid back.   If someone had a month or two where they didn't pay, lenders would stop lending them more money and work out a payment plan to help them pay back the debt.   The opposite is true today.   If someone gets behind on payments, the credit card companies and banks salivate over the money that could be made off of this person by extending them more credit and sinking them further into debt.  Someone who is behind on their payments will have an increase in offers to take out loans or open new cards.   The days when going through bankruptcy ment you could never get approved for another credit card are gone.   Now, those who have just come through bankruptcy recieve the most advertisements to open a new credit card.   The people who can't pay their credit cards on time are the people the banks make the most money off of. \nBankruptcy & having protected accounts (retirement) seems unfair until you consider how unfair the system is to consumers.  It would be nice if they brought back the usury laws to stop the predatory lending."

        "question": "Daughter in credit card trouble I was cleaning up and saw a statement from a credit card company to my daughter. I got nosy and basically found out she has maxed her cards and is drowning.\nI would normally let her struggle and figure it out but one card she has maxed is one her grandmother gave her.  I had no idea my daughter had access to a $7000.00 credit card.  I have taken the cards and had a long difficult talk with her.  Now it\u2019s time to fix the problem.\nShe has 2 cards maxed, one 7k and one 3k.  What is the best way to fix this?  We are calling the cards today to try and stop the bleeding as far as apr and penalties.  Is the answer debt consolidation?  Is it I pay for her grandmothers card and set up a plan for her to pay me and let her struggle thru the card in her name?  Just looking for some advice.  Thanks!",
        "prediction": "The reality is that whilst you block the cards, her situation will only be fixed if she is actually able to pay them off.\nDepending on her total income and sanity, you may be able to help her reduce her cost of living and she pays a ton, lives in small rented enclosed space, reduced food and entertainment costs, etc.\nExtra cash goes to her debt.\nOtherwise, she does a reality check on whether she can earn extra money ie get a second job, look around, if she is in tech/sales she can probably work double time and then look to adjust/switch to earn higher income to better support her cost of living and pay off he debt.\nThe bigger issue though is whether you think your daughter can be responsible here especially if your daughters problem is in purchasing decisions that are not needed ie luxury or \"nice to have\" items.\nIf not, then if she isn't able to correct her problem, she should keep the cards cancelled, live as necessary to cover her credit/debt payments, and never use a card in the future or only an account attached to her own bank account with a proper limit set looking to her total monthly earnings down to her total monthly costs (including debt repayments) tracks consistently.",

        "question": "Girlfriend is underwater on her car payment and feels like she has no options. Are there any? Okay so my girlfriend bought a Jeep last year on May 31st, co signed by her dad. At the time she was working two jobs and was able to pay for it, but since has backed down to one job and is looking at going to school. The payments started at 475 a month but after about 5 months the bank said they hadn't been charging her for something and the payments went up to 560 ( still a little iffy on why that is.) Anyways, she has expressed the desire to trade in for something cheaper and better on gas mileage but is worried she would have to keep paying off the jeep since she is underwater. Is refinancing an option? Would she be able to trade in and pay off the balance over time but for a lower rate? Any input is appreciated, thank you!",
        "prediction": "What is happening is she been punished for her bad credit and caused her to have to keep older payments if she had good credit she might have been able to pay lower interest rates.

She can then go buy another car starting from zero.\nTrade it into a dealership and have them roll the negative equity into the next loan, which may have an even higher rate due to the high risk\n\nThe first option is more ideal, as the second will just put her further underwater.",
        "answer_2": "So, stop thinking of the loan in terms of monthly payments. First, find out the 3 loan details: interest rate, number of months remaining, and current balance. Look at the latest statement to see what this is. Is the balance super high because she put zero down? Did she buy a maintenance plan, and extended warranty, and a bunch of other stuff that she can cancel?\nNow, go onto KBB and NADA. Enter in her Jeep's year, trim, miles, condition, etc. What is her trade-in? What are similar Jeeps selling for around you on Autotrader and cars.com?\nNow, have your girlfriend get on Credit Karma, to see how her credit score is. Has she been making the payments on time? Does she have other credit card debt or anything? Have her make on time payments, pay down debt, etc. to raise her credit score. Unfortunately, she probably can't think about going to school until she saves up a little more. She might even consider just getting out from under the Jeep, and living WITHOUT a vehicle for a while, if possible.\nAnd even if she does buy a car, repeat after me: a car is NOT a monthly payment. She needs to buy cars within her price range, not with some abstract monthly payment."

        "prediction": "\nI have a 512 credit score now and am owing $2,603. I have no idea what to do.\n\nA credit score does not indicate whether or not you owe this money.\nA credit score is a measurement of risk to a creditor.  If they saw your credit report and sees unknown loans with unknown creditors in an unpaid state, they likely think you're an unattractive risk.   That is all.\nIf you know what debts she has or has had, check the credit report for trade lines associated with that loan been reported inaccurately (think about the loan you would have gotten yourself).  You can dispute any items on your report.  Depending on what the loan is, some items can actually amount to fraud, but most of the time it's just someone reporting inaccurate data.  (When you have a loan or CC account and forget that person's name, instead of pulling a hard pull, some banks and indexers let you search to update the information.  Since your name is on the loan, she could likely figure out the original info, update it to her current info, and if that hasn't it made it through the machine yet, it could be in your report.) \nThe other thing you can do is to simply ask her to pay you back in cash and maybe not put it into her account.  If she has her own Paypal or Zelle or Venmo account that you'd use, that might work.  If you don't take cash that way, there's if she has a prepaid debit card, those are usually pretty cheap.  (Or she can get a bank account and Zelle or whatever lender you are comfortable working with.  With Zelle and PayPal, I have Zoombux on both accounts that allows me to send money, so something like that might work for you.\nFinally, check how badly a 512 credit score will hurt you.  Unless you are likely to get a Bill Gates discount as long as you have excellent credit, my guess is that it is not likely to negatively impact where you rent, but you may be required to find someone who has better credit to co-sign the lease with you.

        "question": "Stuck in credit card debt and panicking. So, my mother was generous enough to put me as a secondary on her card. My intention was not to screw her over, but it seems like that's what I've done. I make regular payments, and I pay plenty over the interest rate (often between $50 and $200 each payment when the interest rate is only about $20) and I pay right away when I have the money, but at the moment I have a $2200 balance and it is driving me nuts. \nMy mother has been really understanding and hasn't been mad about it, but I feel so guilty. Is there a way I can get at this debt faster? I feel like there must be some way that I haven't thought of yet.\nRight now, my plan of attack is to just stop spending money on non-debt items. No concerts for a while. No restaurants. I went way overboard and it's time now to just stop it. I can throw that extra money towards my credit card debt. I've also considered, instead of paying extra on my student loan payments, setting more aside for the credit card debt. I've returned all of the purchases that I can. I'm planning out my grocery lists for the next couple weeks so that I can spend less on food and really tackle this credit card debt. $2200 is a lot of money.\nI'm just angry at myself because I have bipolar and I should have known not to hook my credit card up to an online account where I'd be more likely to spend it on stuff I don't need.\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thanks.\nEdit:\nMonthly income: $1200\nRent: $430\nPhone: $30\nTransportation: $40\nInternet: $70\nStudent Loan 1: $120 (total loan is $3,900 at 3.8% variable)\nStudent Loan 2: consolidated, $0/month for the first year but I pay when I can (total loan is $31,400 at 5.875%)\nCredit Card: $20 or more per month (I usually try to pay $150 or so) (total amount is $2,200 at 9% APR)\nGroceries: $200",

That sound doable?",

If you don't have the money or time to play the long game, then you will earn higher returns on your investment via DCAing into passive index, in trying to day trade, or even even investing in the documented 24% stock bonds.\nThat's because of the buy and hold investing theory, that I should use my top VER and take 10 minutes a week if that to set aside around $500, but I'll keep it real....probably gonna be longer...I hate doing work.",

I graduated recently in May, and I got a temporary job for the recent political cycle at a large media consulting firm in the dc area. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before this job was just for the political cycle so it ended in November, being aware of this I saved up my money to survive in the dc area while I applied for other jobs. I saved about 3,000 for two months of rent, with my rent being 1,100 I figured I would be okay (high rent I know I am trying to move to a different place with more roommates so I can save more in the future, right now I have one roommate and this is still the price of rent_. Unfortunately, calamity has struck my family and I had to help my family out with medical bills and this drained my bank account. I recently found a new job on capitol hill working for a member in January, it does not pay much but I have a very good job. I'm a staff assistant and have been guaranteed a quick promotion within the next 3-5 months.\nWith that being said, I am two months behind on rent. My apartment building has been understanding and I am moving out in March, in a few weeks to a cheaper place. Only thing is I need a 1,100 security deposit for this new place, I will have 5 roommates it won't be fun but this is my only option or I will be homeless. The building was understanding, And we have agreed to use my tax returns to cover the amount I owe. Anyways, I am reaching out on this forum for advice for now and the future, I am not sure what to do and I am very scared. My credit score is about 550 which isn't amazing, but it's due to the fact I am a recent grad and haven't had the chance to build my credit score. Also a charged off credit card from college of $450. \nMy question for this forum is how do you guys suggest I finance this security deposit and first month of rent for this new place, I will need 2,100 all together. I get two paychecks for $950 a month. I seriously do not know what to do and I am at my wits end. I currently have one roommate who I would ask to help but he is also a recent graduate and does not have a tremendous amount of money.

It\u2019s a bold move but it may work. \nWouldn\u2019t help if the dude got a fake ID and created some insanely elaborate fake online presence with the true owner\u2019s name. But the odds of that are incredibly low. \nThe scams I see like this are actually local. \nApartment listed on Craigslist, possible tenant shows up & alleged landlord unlocks the door & shows the empty property to him. Offers a big discount for cash in hand deposit & first 3 months up front. Landlord hands over the keys. \nA week or so later, a property manager drops by and is shocked to see his key doesn\u2019t work & somebody living in the house he\u2019s managing for some bank or portfolio. \nTenant is shocked to learn that the landlord was really some random squatter who broke into maybe 3-4 vacant properties , in the area, changed all the locks, posed as a landlord, & just skipped town with $15K-$25K of cash.",
        "answer_2": "Is there anyone in the area that can meet with the prospective landlord?  Is it an agent listing the property for rent or just a regular homeowner?  If you search the property online do you see it for sale anywhere? Was it recently sold?

        "answer_2": "J.P. Morgan, along with many other large banks, had made significant bets on continued increases in the sub-prime lending market. While I can't remember their exact exposure to secondary markets (derivatives, etc.), I do know some of their losses came from their investments in sub-prime mortgages and mortgage backed securities.\nWhen loans go into default, banks that hold mortgage-backed securities acquire the underlying properties as collateral. As more and more properties were defaulted on and subsequently listed by the bank attempting to recover their investment, the housing market was flooded and prices dropped. A drop in the value of the collateralizing asset increases the default risk of a loan because the sale of the property would not recover the outstanding debt. The risk of a loan is a key factor in calculating the expected present value of mortgages, and as home prices dropped the present value of the mortgage-backed securities dropped as well. "

Usually this is a job where a farmer strokes a bull for his 'milk' almost positive there was a dirty jobs episode. \nAfter the jizz is placed in the Female cow she becomes pregnant, pregnancy/birth creates the hormones that allows lactation. \nAfter the baby cow is born their are two options, if its a girl she gets sent off to go through the same cycle as her mother. Now if its a boy this is where it gets sad, they are typically boarded up and made into veal. either way they don't get to drink the milk because its for us.\nNow after the baby cows are out of the equation a machine is used to express the milk from the teat of the cow. After this the milk is processed in two ways: homogenization which keeps the fat from separating, and pasteurization. \nPasteurization is especially key now days since most dairy cows are kept in pretty dirty conditions and the amount of fecal matter that can make its way in from dirty udders is too damn high. \nAfter all of this its placed into either a box or jug or glass bottle depending on how pretentious the milk is. \nNow Im not saying all dairy farms are like this, but honestly the demand for milk is too high for cows to be raised in green pastures.\n(Source: was in FFA, Grew up in aggie town on a farm and visited a lot of CAFOS in central California)",

My wife, and I have all our bills (except mortgage and car payments) set up to auto pay to a capital one CC that we pay off monthly. I checked my accounts this morning, like every morning, and I noticed that the card I use for the bills was showing a $0 balance (expected since I paid it off 3 days ago), but the available credit was also showing $0. I called Capital One, and they said this was because \"the fraud department placed a hold on the last payment to ensure it clears your bank\". The problem is that Capital One IS my bank, they are also the bank holding 2 of my CC (including the one in question), checking/savings accounts, and 1 auto loan. They put a hold on funds coming from their own bank, and in effect froze my credit card until Monday. Have you guys/gals ever heard of this? Am I wrong for thinking this is absolutely ridiculous? How can I get this resloved? I contacted customer service for the CC, but they said they are unable to do anything because the banking side is closed for the holidays.

Essentially a multi-day speculative hornet's nest ripped from the pages of JP Morgan. hexd trying to squeeze blackrock into covering their shorts in the middle of the night, et al. Cash borrowed in order to purchase additional equity in a company means the company can take on more debt. A retail investor if driven to make additional equity must also borrow money in order to make additional equity. And the increase to a company's market cap means that increased lender debt obligations are tangible. So you can short a company's stock to effectively reduce their market cap without shorting their debt. Unfortunately the increase in market cap would be reflected on their debt sheets.\nIt is imperative to take a MMT (modern monetary theory) perspective here in that a company's market cap capitalization is physically antithetical to their debt obligations. So someone buying shorts would logically and rationally be acting out against the short sell agreement which states \"I the person performing the short sell (the short sound made by Morton) cannot construct the artificial market cap to mock a short sell because this would mean going long on a company against which I interned a crucios.

I've always heard praises about the buy and hold strategy and how it played a large part in Warren Buffet's techniques, but 50 years to make a profit does not really seem like a great strategy.

Tried posting this in r/technology where most of the Comcast disaster stories are posted, but it was removed. Since this involves being sent to collections, hopefully it will be welcomed here, as I'm just trying to warn Comcast customers about future fiascos that they may encounter. Also because I've been working really hard on improving my credit, so this pisses me off to no end.\nDisconnected my account because I moved to an apartment complex that they don't service. (I now have WOW Cable, thank God.)\nReceived my final bill for $77.60, which says the due date is 10/05/14. Okay! No biggie. At least they didn't cause a whole final bill fiasco, charge me for equipment that I returned, or any of the other terrifying situations that I've read about involving dealing with Comcast and closing accounts.\nI thought all was well too soon I suppose. I get a call a day or two after receiving my final bill in the mail from a collections agency telling me that my account has been turned over to them and they want me to pay my balance right away.\nPoints I try to argue: A) My bill is not due until 10/05/14. B) I JUST GOT MY FINAL STATEMENT OF $77.60 NOT EVEN 2 DAYS AGO! C) My account was disconnected as of 9/14/14! How can I be in collections if it hasn't even been 30 days since the disconnection of my service?\nThe person calling me is from overseas, I try to explain my situation and why my account should not even be her business because it shouldn't be in collections at all. I pay my bills. Every month. On time. By the due date. For over four years I paid the ungodly amounts that they wanted for average speed \"HSI\" and television channels that play the same crap over and over.\nOf course none of this matters to her, because there is such a language barrier. She doesn't understand what I'm saying. I'm wasting my breath. I might as well be talking to a brick wall.\nI hang up and call Comcast directly to find out what's going on. Again, I get someone from overseas who is of no help. How can someone help me if they can't understand what my dilemma is to begin with? I ask for a supervisor, and I'm put on hold for so long that I decide to concede. I hang up, and call the automated system to pay the amount due to bring my account to a zero balance, because I don't want to receive harassing phone calls from this collection agency or be bothered with Comcast at all anymore.\nI just want to forewarn everyone out there that this is the kind of crap Comcast continues to pull.

They too have to deal with equivalents of collection agencies. Furthermore, that they have an accent does not mean they cannot understand you --you have an accent from their point of view.

        "answer_1": "No disrespect towards bank clerks, but their job is to carry out what is asked of them, not give advice. At best they are familiar with sales pitches and will try to push you towards what is best for the bank, but not necessarily for you. Maybe that's why he recommends real estate (interest from mortgage for the bank) and gold (renting a safe at the bank). Neither of those also have guaranteed returns.\nReinvesting dividends is definitely a good idea.",
        "answer_2": "Banks primarily make money by commission, fees, and interest payments on loans. They are trying to sell you products or encourage behaviors that will lead you back to their products.\nThe bank is not somewhere you want to be taking financial advice from. "

        "question": "What does it mean when a company is heavily owned by institutions? For example, 73.1% of Google stock is owned by institutions according to this: \nWhat does it mean when over 90% of the stock is owned by institutions? Is it unusual? Also, what does it mean when the % of Float is above 100%?",
        "prediction": "Institutions are generally big players in the stock market. They often account for a majority of the trades and a majority of the ownership of the company. \nA high percentage of institutional ownership is generally a good thing, though not necessarily when it reaches above 90%. \nA high percentage ownership means the stock has probably been around for a long time and has solidified itself. It also means it's a good investment because other people with an investment in the company think so too. Purchasing the stock gives you a piece of a legitimate and valuable company which an institution also recognizes. ",
        "answer_1": "Institution = Mutual, Index, Pension, and Hedge funds. Stocks owned mainly by institutions can be a double edged sword. On one hand they have analyst who believe the company has good fundamentals. However any manager whose having a bad quarter can easily dump the stock out of their portfolio causing it to tank.",
        "answer_2": "float over 100% can happen if alot of shares are sold short. if 20% of the stock is short, then up to 120% of the actual float could be reported long."

        "question": "any downfalls of paying off your mortgage early? i understand the pros of paying off your mortgage early...no payments, house is in your name alone. the only downfall i can think of is not having the interest of the mortgage as a tax write-off. i'm hoping my dad (who is financially illiterate) will pay it off soon but i'm trying foresee the downfalls.",
        "prediction": "So, the biggest issue is opportunity cost.  Far too many people use the extra discretionary income to throw it at the principle rather than investing in their 401k or a Roth IRA. In every financial situation I know of, the best case scenario is to contribute money to a 401k up to the match, max out IRA, then throw any extra at the house.\nWhen you throw money at an investment account today (+ compound interest) there is the possibility that it may be worth a lot more than the interest savings when applied to a mortgage.  Conversely, most types of debt are pretty secure (like a FHA mortgage) and if the market were to crash, you still get to pay the lower amount.\nSo, if someone is actually in-charge of their 401k and making consistent $5k contributions every year, this is not as big an issue.",
        "answer_1": "YOU DO NOT GET ALL YOUR INTEREST BACK AS A TAX WRITE-OFF. That is a misconception. You only get a part back of the interest you have paid during that year. So paying no interest (because you've paid off the house) beats paying interest and getting perhaps some of it back. \nOne reason to not pay off the mortgage now would be if you needed the money for something else. Always keep a healthy emergency fund, so that if any financial crisis happens you do not have to borrow money to cover for it. ",
        "answer_2": "Well, from what I understand about mortgages, (which is not a lot) your initial payments are payments more towards interest, and the latter payments are more towards the principal.\nExample: If you got a 15 yr loan, and you try to pay more than the minimum around year 3, your first payment will be mostly interest payment and any extra will go towards the principal (reducing future interest thus saving money). If you start doing this at year 13, you've already paid most of the loan's interest and now its basically almost all principal. your really not saving too much money (although you would be saving a little)\nbasically the downside of this is what poloplyerrl said.

I'm very debt-adverse, a by-product of being fortunate to never fall into debt and frugal Asian parents. My income is such that I can easily afford monthly payments.

In the long been most stock market investments have appreciated more than you would pay in interest payments if you had taken out a loan but it's nowhere near a guarantee.

For example, Ford gave me a $2,000 rebate to take out a loan. Even if you want to pay cash in this case it makes sense to take the loan and just pay it off immediately. ",
        "answer_2": "If you have the cash go buy a slightly used version of what you want and save a bundle. My company has a policy they only buy white impalas with less than 45k miles for less than 15k. They replace them after 200k miles.

My husband says that even though we can take the 250k left from selling our current home (or a portion thereof) and use it as a down payment on the new home, we will end up having zero equity because we\u2019ll be starting a new mortgage.

        "question": "Does it make sense for me to spend all of my savings on college? Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college and to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually not a very good thing?\nMy boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me before I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to <$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I recieved it in the year which would affect my aid.  \nMy feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.\n\u2022 I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.\nI'm a long time lurker here, and after seeing some similar posts recently, I felt inspired to share my situation and talk to the kind people at r/personalfinance who're more financially adept than I am. It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, and emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.\n\nGrants wouldn't save you that much, my boyfriend could be telling me to spend 80k to save >15k over the years right? I've no way of knowing how much to keep before its hurting me, or if I start spending more than I'd save in grants. What do you think the smartest way to use this money is?",
        "prediction": "Hi there, I'm a financial accountant so I wanted to weigh in  on this.\nI would do the following - set up a trust fund where you can store the money to help you follow through with intended spending rather than be tempted to spend it on something else. Make a business plan for yourself with you boyfriend, describe what you'll be using it for, be clear on all future costs. Use the trust fund to manage funds where you can transfer funds monthly to another savings account. \nKeep in mind what your boyfriend said - before your father passed, would you have been able to afford MCC with this money? In an emergency are you friend or family going to help support you, would you need the emergency funds saved? \nYou might have to have a frank discussion with her regarding your plans for the money - at the end of the day as long as you stick to your plan, your mum will forgive you.",

Ideally, you shouldn't have told him about the money, because now he is more likely to try and get it out of you. But the cat is out of the bag. As much as possible, save that money and pretend it's not there (i.e., keep working and saving as you were before). \nIn order to prevent spending all of the money on school, would you be open to considering doing 2 years at a community college? My partner went this route and probably saved about $20k.",
        "answer_2": "I think your boyfriend may have a point, by receiving that money now you may have lost eligibility to financial aid for this year. I think the suggestion to spend some of it to get your eligibility back has some merit, but don't spend it on him and don't spend on anything that you wouldn't have spent originally. That's why he said to prepay your mum's rent.\nI dont know what you can do now, but it may be good to keep looking into how you can get your eligibility for financial aid back starting next year."

With most brokers, they are a publicly traded company owned by shareholders who might use the company as broker or those who don\u2019t with the only relationship with the company being via ownership of the company\u2019s shares. \nFor example, let\u2019s use Charles Schwab. They are publicly traded and have shareholders who each own a percentage of the company like any other publicly traded company. Schwab may offer funds with names like Schwab International or Schwab Tech that are products they offer. You can own any of these funds but that doesn\u2019t equal ownership in Charles Schwab the company, only their funds. Unless you actually own shares of Charles Schwab the company, you\u2019re just treating the company as a company you do business with. For example, I can use Vanguard for everything in my portfolio but also own shares of Charles Schwab the company in my Vanguard portfolio. Thus, I own both companies. If I use Schwab for my whole portfolio but don\u2019t actually hold any shares of Schwab the company then I only own whatever is in my portfolio and nothing for Charles Schwab the company.\nThe advantages of Vanguard being own by their funds/shareholders of these funds is that they don\u2019t have to focus as much on returning money back shareholders like a publicly traded company does. There is no dividend payout or pressure to grow to please shareholders. Instead their funds and the companies within those funds will take care of all that for them. Because they don\u2019t have these responsibilities, they can pass down the cost savings of no dividend payouts or having to spend money to grow to users of the Vanguard platform via low fees/expenses. If Vanguard was publicly traded like Charles Schwab then they\u2019d have to take care of costs of running the company first, then the costs of rewarding the shareholders next before doing anything for the users (not the shareholders of Schwab) of their services last.\nIt\u2019s definitely confusing and complicated and I\u2019m not even sure how big of a difference it makes realistically today but that\u2019s the best I can explain it.",

If long term you really think you'll be making 13k/year and your student debt is paid off within 5 years, maybe you will get more comfortable living with 3500+. Even if you don't get that promotion the 36% rule stil holds true so that's 3300 at least. But for now you have a new house to take care of, so it's not the right time yet. First make sure you pay off all your debt. ",

You are obtaining benefit on a change of price when value is created by owning a piece that company.\nSplitting the line the way I described it...

I started cooking all my own food, growing a lot of my own vegetables (outdoors and indoors), building computers, bikes, extensions to the house. Over time I realized that making my own stuff has given me a true sense of pride.

        "question": "I got some unexpected advice from my parents today - they told me to consider raising my budget for rent.  Are they right - am I being too frugal / unrealistic? Recent college grad here who's starting a new job next week.  I'm subletting an apartment for the summer from a friend (got a great deal for an amazing place), but now I'm looking for an apartment to lease starting in August.  I work outside Atlanta in a city called Alpharetta, so there are a ton of options in the area, both in terms of price and in terms of location.\nI've been fortunate in that my parents have covered my rent while I'm in college, but this has now left me in a position where I'm a little unsure of what I should be paying for rent.  My plan was to live frugally over the next few years so that I could quickly pay off a $26,000 loan I owe my parents for my last year of college.  I made this plan with the understanding that it would likely necessitate a drop in living standard from what I've had while my parents were supporting me.\nI was aiming to spend about $600 a month on rent + $100 a month on utilities.  Here is my full budget (I made what I thought were conservative estimates, so some of the categories may be a little high):\nIncome\n\n$2300 (monthly after-tax)\n\nExpenses\n\n$600 Rent\n$100 Utilities\n$200 Groceries\n$50 Restaurants\n$200 Auto Insurance\n$20 Highway Toll\n$200 Gas\n$215 Loan Payment\n$50 Entertainment\n$30 Haircut\n$25 Miscellaneous\n$8 Hulu Plus\n\nLeft Over\n\n$602\n\nBasically my plan was to take that extra $602 a month an throw it at my loan so that I could be done with it as soon as possible.  I talked to my parents today though, and they said that I shouldn't constrict myself too much - that if I was able to find a better apartment in a better location I should consider spending an extra hundred or two a month; that I shouldn't kill myself to be too frugal.  Keep in mind that my parents are the epitome of frugal - they have literally no debt, pay cash for their cars, coupon, etc.\nNow I will admit that there is a big difference between a $600 a month apartment in Atlanta and an $800 a month apartment.  For $800 I could live in a gated community with a pool and tennis courts in a good location like the Virginia Highlands or Buckhead.  For $600 a month I'm going to have to look for something less fancy, in a less desirable and potentially less safe location.\nI was willing to make a little bit of a sacrifice in terms of my living accommodations in order to get my financial house in order, but now my parents have thrown me for a loop.  What should I do?",
        "prediction": "The thing is, the more you spend, the more you spent.

Now you can afford the slightly higher amount you already \"got used to\".  So again, you gradually raise that amount incrementally, if you can.  And if something new comes along bringing income down, now you have to raise that number back up  again.\nBut unless you do the work to avoid debt and live on less, your income will continue to constrain you to the things you want rather than need, the portions of your life spent cooking instead of partying with friends, the safe area with healthy playgrounds for your kids instead of the ghetto where rent is quick and easy to get into.\nAnd where middling or new drivers forget the statistical likelihood of accidents and repair costs on your insurance all rise to absurd levels leaving no coins in your pocket to rub together at the end of paychecks.\nKeep that rent and expenses as low as possible and adjust the entire budget as necessary to leave you the most possible for savings and paying off your loan quickly.

        "question": "Update: I\u2019ve had 6 offers and still can\u2019t sell my house Thank you everyone for all the advice.  I asked my realtor if we could add a time is of the essence clause, up the deposit and add a bonus to the agent who brought A buyer.  She said no to all three. I had originally stuck with this agent because my fianc\u00e9 insisted on using her. He\u2019s pretty mad that I\u2019ve cut ties with her and that\u2019s a new dynamic that I don\u2019t quite understand.\nI got a final offer on my house that was really low, so low that I was only going to break even on it.  I accepted and the buyers backed out 5 days later and the reason they gave was that they couldn\u2019t afford the payment. Because buyers in California have 17 days to back out I don\u2019t receive any earnest money.  I\u2019ve taken my house off the market and severed ties with my agent.\nIt\u2019s been almost three months since I\u2019ve put my house on the market. A house similar size as mine but without an updated kitchen (it has a white porcelain counter and I have granite) was just listed 40k higher than mine and after talking to the buyer they\u2019ve received a nearly full price offer. I\u2019m thinking my house probably looks like something is wrong with it due to it being on the market so long.   I guess I\u2019ll hold on to it for another year or so and try again. \nThanks for reading this novel and for all the advice :)\nOriginal post:\nSo as stated, I can\u2019t sell my house.  The house was built in 2011. I bought it dec 2014 for 255k.  I am in the Central Valley of California.  My house is part of a planned community that was half built when I bought my house.  The houses built after I bought my house are roughly 1000 square foot larger and cost about 100k more.  The house has granite, wood floors, new carpet (2017) and has been painted with a fresh coat of paint.  It is in a gated complex with access to a pool, water park and playground.\nI am getting married in 26 days and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they\u2019ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.\nThis past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I\u2019m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.\nWe are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it\u2019s not a great option with this house.\nDoes anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?\nThank you so much for reading this!",

Once my due diligence comes through, I personally treat it as a matter of fact, lets the buyer have the contingencies as long as they are within the due diligence days spec'd out. Once the deadline is up, it's firm and they can get it inspected for something bad but just meaning ill continue to move forward.

If you're a homeowner, you can calculate your mortgage:income ratio (sometimes called a front-end ratio) by dividing your monthly mortgage costs (usually including associated costs like homeowner's insurance, property tax and mortgage insurance) by your pretax monthly salary.\nFor example, if you earn $10,000 per month ($120,000 per year salary) and you pay $2,000 per month in mortgage costs and related fees, your mortgage:income ratio is 0.20.\n0.20 = 2,000 / 10,000\n\nLenders recommend that this number not go above 0.28, but we at Personal Finance know that this number should be as low as you can make it while meeting your housing requirements. So I'd love to hear from folks who own their homes:\n\nWhat is your mortgage:income ratio? What was it when you bought your house?\nWhat area do you live in? (or: do you live in a low or high cost-of-living area?)\nDoes your mortgage feel too high?

        "answer_1": "The earlier you start the better you are be proud you are already thinking of the long term at your age. Life gets expensive quickly at your age, make responsible purchases. Budget and don't be afraid to work a OT or pick up a second job, to boost those contributions and get ahead a bit. Be careful about what loans you take out they will follow you for a long time, and be responsible about what cars you finance.",
        "answer_2": "Google a compound interest calculator.  Put in your annual savings at an interest rate of 10% (stock market average) assuming you are smartly investing in a broad market fund.  Then change the years around and amounts putting in.  So let's say you want to retire at 62. Put 40 years and then put in how much you'll be adding every year.  Now do 30 years.  Now do 20 years.  Now do 10 years.  The difference in the amount will likely be absolutely shocking to you.  So yes, starting at 22 instead of 32 or 40 is a MASSIVE difference in what you'll have as you get older.  And the good thing is, when you start this young, you also give yourself the option of retiring earlier if you decide to."

        "question": "So, my grandmother wants some advice. (90 years old and in great health, wants to invest 150k from the sale of her home) My grandmother moved from her home to a retirement community last year, and she just sold her home for about 150k. She wants me to research mutual funds that she can put the money into -and- withdraw an average of 1600 per month. Am I right in telling her that mutual funds are the wrong way to go? She's not going to find any funds that distribute $1600 monthly from 150k, and she needs this money to last at least 10 years. What can I recommend to her instead that will be stable and present minimal tax burden for monthly withdrawals?",

People are living longer and living longer healthy lives and she may end up needing a lot of $ to keep up on her needs. \nThe downside for her is it's often easier to have more $ when you're older than when you're a penniless single Mother with three kids. m\u1ed9t l\u1eeda (something close to one half). If $ is not something her family is used to then she may have a hard time with managing it on her own. \nThen there's children or grandchildren or others trying to \"help\" without permission. The ones helping you also may be the ones stealing from you or making financial decisions that are not in your best interest. Presents from you and your estate that are needed for if or when you need them. Sometimes family disagreements happen because one walks away from $ when the will is read. As a homeowner or someone looking to move out of their home or into an assisted living situation complicates that. \nShe probably has a lot of good advice to give you, it would be good for her to find somebody to help her with her decisions.

I'm sorry but I wholeheartedly disagree with all the people saying you owe it to your kids to work, I actually think you owe it to your kids and yourself to enjoy the rest of your life the way you want to. Given your situation, your house is paid for (you have a roof over your head), and you're a handyman so if something breaks you can likely fix it.  Spend time with your kids.

I initially put in ~$430 to my Robinhood account, which I\u2019ve grown to ~$500 based on what I\u2019ve learned through reading articles/books and watching a lot of YouTube. Since I\u2019ve begun, I\u2019ve only invested in \u201cbig name\u201d stocks (CGC, AAPL, TSLA, etc). \nEverywhere I look, I always see how the S&P 500 has succeeded immensely in the last 20 years, with most traders being unable to beat it.

I have about 3k saved up and was considering putting 1.5-2k in ETFs like SPY or VOO while keeping the $500 I already have in Robinhood to play around with other actual stocks. I guess this leads me to my questions:\nWould it be smart to throw such a large portion of my money into S&P 500 ETFs?\nWhy is there so much hype surrounding it?\nAre there any bear cases for it?\nI realize I can find a lot of this info online, but I want to see a lot of individual takes on this since I\u2019m just getting into the game.

        "prediction": "Index funds are safer for many small time non-professional investors for three main reasons:\n-They are well diversified, therefore if one of the companies in the index does bad, it won't weigh too much on your investments. This can be thought of as a \"poor man diversification\" of he stocks trying to day trade. Instead of you investing in 10 stocks, trying to get your best 5 in order to outperform the S&P, you should use the top 500 stocks.\n-Most mutual and hedge fund managers have a fee of some sorts. Even if a mutual fund manager is top notch, she won't be cheap. So, even if you are outpacing the index by more then the fee, you're probably getting paid a lot on her looking at her track record. Of course it would be the best to beat the index tracks that outperform the market, but not too many do, and some of those that do likely do due to luck and not as long term performance. So why overpay for a journeyman fund manager to get slight incremental returns and risk trying to find one the the few performing fund managers.  \n-If you are savvy enough to consistently outperform the market at his age, then it doesn't really matter where you invest. I would suggest against it, simply for the high risk. Using leverage to outpace the market is a high risk investment strategy and by over leveraging your portfolio there is potential for you to get into very costly margin calls. Even skilled pros can get margin called.\nLong story short, you should look at what the S&P outperforms a lot of your active stock portfolio, look up the fees for your brokers, and probably look to cut them out. \nAlso, that $3000 has the potential to grow to a lot by being set aside in a index fund vs trying to to outperform it. You can best your peers by actually saving more then them, by allowing it to grow. Interst is a beautiful thing. \nPS there are also other indices for different markets. If you make a lot of money later and want a higher risk, check out the S&P500 growth index. S&P500 but more weighted towards growth stocks.\nGood luck. ",
        "answer_1": "Because if you buy stocks on your own, the high liklihood is that you may do well initially, but eventually you'll get in something that doesn't do well and you'll not want to sell because then you'd be \"losing money\".

        "answer_2": "This year's winners are next years losers and last year's losers are this year's winners.

Sounds like you've got no real prize, the best year is the only one worth mention, which was when you actually had the conviction not to get into quick debt in the first place. Maybe you don't need the new car or the great apartment. Maybe you actually learnt what your cost of living before your great leap eg. spending always trumps saving.",

It sounds like your trip was all of those things, and as long as you could afford it, there's no need to feel guilty! \nI'm a travel-fiend, it's the number one thing I spend my money on. So if you hadn't gone on that trip, what would you have spent your money on? If you still plan on making all your bills on time this month, then it probably wouldn't have been anything crucial. You maybe would have gone to a couple movies, a few restaurants, maybe bought a few Amazon purchases, whatever you spend money on. Or maybe the number in your bank account would be a bit higher. \nBut now, instead of that, you have this amazing experience. A story that could make you more interesting when meeting a new person. Memories with your friend, and experiences you hadn't had before. For the rest of your life, when someone mentions the name of the place you went, you are going to have a built in conversation piece. \nThat is EXACTLY the reason I spend money on travel...I don't think there is a dollar amount that you can put on the learning, culture-expansion, and fun that you have by seeing new places and meeting new people.

You could file in [small claims court](  for a $14/$29 filing fee (plus other fees) and you could recover those fees if you win, but you can't squeeze blood from a stone; if the other driver can't pay, you probably won't get anything.",

        "question": "My wife will receive a generous defined-benefits pension. How should this affect our savings habits? To hell with our IRAs? My wife is an assistant principal of public high school in Brooklyn and makes about $100k. At 31, she's been with the Dept. of Ed. for 9 years, and if she retires at about 60 (38 years service time), she'll have a little more then 70% of her salary paid out to her until she dies. Let me say outright how bloody fortunate we are. Well aware, and humbled.\nI make in the neighborhood of $30k as your friendly neighborhood security guard, and together we have about $7k a month in take-home pay (after 10% goes to our retirement plans), of which about $4k is gobbled by fixed and semi-fixed expenses, notably a $2200 mortgage with $620/mo maintenance fee (it's Brooklyn.) That leaves $3k. (We also have a 1 year old child.)\nEverything I've read on this lovely, lovely sub stresses heavy retirement savings, which has been enlightening. But it seems like we'll be well set for retirement, especially when our mortgage is paid off when we're both 61 (hopefully.) So I'm kind of not sure what to do with my savings.\nWe have the kid, so I wonder if I should forego IRA contributions and instead plow the money into a 529? Other things I've thought of doing are paying off our modest car loan and our modest student loans, or maybe even throwing money at our mortgage to pay down the principal (4.5% interest)? Then I've also thought: \"You're being dumb, you should still put in an IRA. Maybe a Roth IRA so you can pull from it.\"\nThen there's investing. I'm a rank amateur in this field and will do more research. But I'd be interested in building up -- maybe in lieu of those IRAs -- a semi-liquid \"Big Ticket Fund,\" to spend on things like vacations, home renovations, kids' camps and travel teams, etc. I'd like this to be accessible, obviously, but it seems like I could build it big enough that part of the money could be out there doing work. Index funds? Or maybe this should be the Roth IRA?\nA few last things. 1. I definitely realize nothing is a sure thing, though I would be very surprised if my wife lost her job. She's tenured, and very good at it. I guess it would be more likely she'd decide on other employment, but this seems very unlikely too. And I'd be thunderstruck if we ever divorced. We're extremely solid 7 years in. 2. I am not sure, on the other hand, if her pension could be legally pared down in the future. I would of course be interested in information here. 3. I plan on insuring both our lives but haven't gotten there quick yet. All of this is a process -- thanks PF! 4. I believe in generally living modestly instead of precise budgeting, so though I understand where you're coming from if you think it's folly, I don't want my \"big ticket fund\" weighted toward particular goals. I have a small kid, might have another, and truly don't know what to expect out of life.\nMany thanks for your help, peeps.

In the NYC pension system, this is unfortunately relevatively low -- the NYC Comptroller mentioned once at a meeting that the plan was 77% funded and that her base rule of thumb was that she thought they had a the funds to pay off 90%, so it shouldn't be a huge worry.

        "prediction": "Mutual funds will be traded at the end of the day at their NAV... ETFs are traded via the exchanges, but also bought and sold at their NAV (minus added commission, if applicable, through the broker account). If the company in question is an instantaneous trader, they might buy and sell at the price of the next transaction.\nSo if you want lower commissions (with a discount broker) and instantaneous trade, get the ETF. If you want one transaction at a time at their NAV, get the mutual fund.\nI'm mainly going with those definitions for mutual funds because the US funds I used to work with are only offered to the public as commission-free.",

A mutual fund with the same share price would allow you to buy 9.901 shares.\nETFs generally have a lower expense ratio and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at a variable price whereas traditional mutual funds have a single updated price at the end of every day (NAV = net asset value).\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages so it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish and which financial institution you're working with.",
        "answer_2": "You've gotten good advice here.  I'll just add that it may also depend on how much you have to invest and when.  \nIf you can invest $500/month minimum, then ETFs are probably fine.  You can generally buy a number of shares that is roughly equivalent to that amount.  Obviously, the more you invest monthly the easier it is to get close to an exact amount, but it will always be off by a little.  For a long time, I did a combo of VTI, VXUS and BND that I could get to pretty close to $1000/month when that was my investment budget.\nOn the other hand, if you just want to do a set amount each month without worrying about it, you can do the mutual funds with fixed amounts very easily."

        "question": "Should I buy a house with the intention of renting it out and moving within 2-5 years? (Details inside) We are considering buying a house and looking for advice if it makes financial sense. I work for a government agency and currently putting in for location transfer when they solicit every 6 months. Now the likelihood of my transfer getting approved probably won't happen for the next 2-5 years, but I continue to request the transfer to help my chances down the road when its actually realistic. \nThe housing market in my area is doing well and the prices are really good for brand new builds. We would most likely purchase a brand new build with the intention of renting it out when if/when we move. I'm in a military/government city which makes the chances of renting it out down the road pretty good. My desired transfer location would be in the same state which makes managing a rental a little easier. \nAlso when my agency approves a move they give you a lump sum of money depending on if you rent or own to help in the moving costs. If I rent a home I would receive around $25,000, if I own my own home I would receive $48,000. This is all before taxes by the way so the actual amount is a bit lower. Another thing in our court is our family member is a real estate agent and agreed to help us with the process. \nWe have excellent credit and would be able to put down $20,000 on a house. \nTo sum it up: Does it make sense to buy a house with my current situation with the intention of renting it out and moving in the next 2-5 years? \nThank you so much for your help!!",
        "prediction": "One important questions is, how will you know what rent you can get for that neighborhood in the future?

If not, I\u2019d be very wary.",
        "answer_1": "As a rule of thumb, your monthly rent should be about 1% of your purchase price in order to cover all of your expenses and make decent cash flow.  So like if you buy a house for $300k you should be able to rent it out for $3000/mo.\nHowever I think that you will find that in areas with a strong housing market you'll get something like 50-60% of that, i.e. $1500-1700/mo.  If you run the numbers and include all costs, property tax, insurance, vacancy, marketing expenses, repair and upkeep, you'll probably be basically breaking even on a cash flow basis.  So the only way you will make money is through appreciation and paying down your mortgage.  You will make a little bit this way but if you consider your down payment tied up in the house it might not be a very good return on investment.  It would all depend on the appreciation.\nManaging a rental property when you don't live in the area is difficult because you can't go see the property and have to depend 100% on people that you hire to go out there.  If you hire a company to take care of everything, expect to pay about 8-10% of the rent to them as a fee.  This further cuts into your cash flows and if the company doesn't do a great job it can lead to additional expenses.\nOverall I'd take a very realistic look at the numbers and make sure it is worthwhile.  I would be surprised if it is. Source: I've been a landlord for 25 years.",

Example: tool-making, wood carving, jewelry-making.  Reserve enough time outside of work hours to make a little progress every day.  Aim to start a business selling your widgets, and gain profits from your passion.   If it starts to pick up, you may negotiate taking Tuesdays off or something to allow you more freedom in growing this pursuit.  \nAnother thing to consider is purchasing a percentage of the business.  If you have good enough savings or credit to invest in the company, such as to have a reasonable percentage of ownership, then you are effectively a partner.  As part owner, you should be able to bring up a vote to increase your own salary by a percentage at the next shareholder meeting.  If you buy a controlling stake, no votes are necessary.  \nI know two insurance salesmen.  One was working at the local Tea store for extra cash, then within a few years, bought the franchise location and only pokes his head in every two weeks or so.  The other has a huge grill and makes plastic-wrapped barbecue plates by the dozens and sells them to local businesses.  I think he even spends his lunch-break delivering them to offices around town.  \nIt's totally feasible to get a dirt cheap website set up showcasing some of your.... personalized hammers or what-have-you, and make web-sales, shipping on the weekends, of things that you made in your productive hobby-time.

        "answer_1": "I am a home health social worker. \nFor starters, get Grandma & Grandpa both on Medicaid. Different states have different rules about Medicaid. If they have any savings accounts, they will need to spend that money. Do NOT let them write you (or anyone else) a big check for thousands of dollars as a way of getting rid of it, it can mess up the Medicaid process and complicate it. \nIf the house is paid for, they might consider a reverse mortgage which means that the bank buys their house and makes payments to them for several years. This can also complicate the Medicaid process, so just be careful and try to get with an attorney who knows all the ins and outs of your state's Medicaid rules. \nSome nursing homes will take Grandma now if they know for sure that she will be approved for Medicaid. You'd have to call around and ask; usually there's at least one in each town that does that. \nSpeaking of nursing homes, the kind that you really want to put Grandma in is one with a memory care unit. This is a locked-door facility. Staff and visitors can come and go, but the patients stay and are entertained and fed and cared for all in the same place; they aren't allowed to wander. \nAlso, when picking a nursing home, show up unannounced for a visit. Don't call and ask them what their hours are or visiting policy or tip them off in any way that you are coming. Just show up. You don't want them to have time to make the place look nice just for your visit. \nAnd finally, these may be harder to find, but there are nursing homes in the community that look like regular everyday homes. They may not even have a sign out front. These places can be hit or miss. Some are fantastic and some I wouldn't send my worst enemy to, but by and large, their prices are actually pretty reasonable, usually in the $2-3K range. They may be listed in the phone book, or you can sometimes ask around, sometimes nurses know about them by word of mouth.",

They can help with assessing your grandmother to get her admitted to a facility and discuss the financial costs of doing so.\nIf your grandparents have savings/cincome wise and in general everything is split down the middle and everything on the side of grandma will go to pay for her cost of care.  Medicaid has a 5 year look back at all financial transactions and a case worker would be looking at bank statements, retirement accounts, stocks, etc.  Any asset.   Primary residences are normally excluded from asset checks as long as a spouse is using it as a primary residence.  Some income is also excluded from her side, for the spouse to live off of.  If there are a lot of complex accounts that your grandparents have it might be good to utilize an elder law attorney to do an application that will protect as much as possible for your grandfather's benefit.  If there is little to no savings less, then just go talk to a nursing home and work with them to put in an application with the state.  Most facilities i've worked at will help you organize the application and submit it themselves, so they actually get paid.   After everything is calculated, granddad will just pay whatever amounts decided upon out of savings and then eventually just a part of the monthly income (and then the facility bills the rest to the state for reimbursement).  Applications can take a while to approve for the state, but as long as everyone is helping with the process most facilities have no issue staying in a Medicaid pending status.\n&x200B\nIf there are any questionable gifts of large sums of money in the past 5 years (maybe longer in some states) that may make eligibility impossible."

The thing is though, I do not really know much about the pharmaceutical industry.\nI am hoping some of you could provide some insight into this industry for me.  Who are the major players, who should I keep a watchful eye on, are there any companies I should avoid, what are some trade publications or resources I could look at to help further my knowledge?  \nAny advice ya'll would be willing to share would be greatly appreciated!\nTL:DR I know nothing about the pharmaceutical industry.

I moved out of my parent's house over a year and a half ago, and living on my own I've learned some things, one being that I am a terrible cook, and second is I do not know how to grocery shop.\nI'm really bad at it. I don't pay attention to price, I just grab whatever is there and go. And when it comes to food, it's even worse.

Cook 1-2 pounds in the beginning of the week (I prefer to do it in the crock pot on low heat) and eat/eat what you made. Cook the rest of the pound(s) that you did not prepare in some spices of your liking and go from there. Don't be afraid to ask your teammates for recommendations long the way, especially since you do work at a grocery store and talk to people who are like minded and trying to save money. For the rest of your meals, look up sound choices for foods you're interested in the grocery store. If you eat it more than once a week, buy it in bulk. Whether that be frozen or canned. Google foods that you can freeze AFTER you made a meal with them (chicken soup/chili, etc). Canned food never really goes bad so find alternatives. For things perishable, just portion out your stuff from the pack (anything from veggies to avocados to spices) a few at a time. For spices look up different spices that would suit your taste buds.

I do apologize if this is not the best place for this query.\nType:\n26-Week Bill\nPar Amount:\n$1,000.00\nPurchase Price:\n$987.66\nInvestment/Interest Rate:\n2.505%\nYield:\n2.440%\nPrice per $100:\n98.766444\nDiscount:\n$12.34\nIssue Date:\n02-07-2019\nMaturity Date:\n08-08-2019\nNumber of Reinvestments:\n1\n1) What is the difference between the \"Investment/Interest rate\" and the \"Yield\", in this case? Since it's a zero coupon bond, my effective return is 2.49%  (12.34 * 2/987.66)\n2) Since I selected 1 reinvestment, does this mean the money automatically rolls over at the end of 6 months into another on-the-run 6M treasury bill? If so, I presume the yield on that would be the yield 6 months from now (ie I don't lock in the current price/return). Is this right?\nThanks!",

Also, it is guaranteed to hold your amount.",

My parents [Late 40s]  are first time home buyers but my dad just changed jobs and his credit isn\u2019t in the best shape right now therefore using him in the mortgage loan process will not work out. My mom has good credit but low income so she asked if I will cosign on a $229,999 property with her because I have good credit and currently working. The only thing is I work part time and I am also a full time student, I\u2019m thinking the job I have at the moment is not  stable enough to the point I can rely on my income although I won\u2019t be paying for the home and everything that comes along with owning one, my parents will.  Is this a risky decision? How can I tell my parents they are putting my financial life in jeopardy if it is?\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you!",
        "prediction": "Long story short, here are the reasons you should be completely against this:\n1) If anything happens economically and you ever need to get a loan yourself for a house, a car, a credit card, or anything else that a loan would be needed for, that debt, even if your index is $0, to Include interest, can be used against you. So for many years to come, you won\u2019t have a strong financial position to be able to take on any extra additional debts.\n2) If your parents are going bankrupt or in collections or a payment plan, you will be hit with those payments, and may be responsible for them trying to acquire a loan without contacting you.\n3) If they miss payments, get your credit dinged in order to get additional loans, get late or no payments, you will take the hit for the duration if you agree to co-sign.

But if you did, you could put roughly $950 more per month toward the loan.  You should also stop trying to save when you're drowning in debt.  You said your emergency fund is good to go.  Start putting that $600 towards the debt instead.\nWith an extra $1,550 going towards the loan, it will be paid off somewhere in the middle of 2020.  Less than five years.  If you work more overtime and get pay increases, it could be less than that.\nImagine the loan being gone.  Completely paid off.  You can move forward with your life and not be a burden to yourself or your parents.  That would feel amazing, right?  3-5 years living with the parents to make that happen sounds a shit ton better to me than having that hang over your (and their) head for the next 10. ",
        "answer_2": "First, I completely sympathize. Student loans suck for a variety of reasons. you need to educate yourself about student loans before you will really be in a position to come up with a workable plan.  I have found Heather Jarvis' site to be very helpful:  \nIt is possible to refi your loans to obtain both a better interest rate and a lower monthly payment. Of course one of the other factors is that this involves amortizing your loans over a longer period. Which means you will pay more in the long run and it will take longer to pay off the loans. This also means going from federal to private loans which reduces the payment deferral options available to you. But if the current payment plan just isn't working then you have to change something. \nI did a quick back of the envelope calculation of 185k principle at 8% with a 10 year amortization. The monthly payment amount I am calculating is around $2200 per month. So your parents' current loans do not appear to be on any sort of income based repayment plan. \nWhen you are ready to refi you will want to shop the loans around a bit. Keep sofi.com in mind as one of the places you check. \nGood luck!"

The reason I am asking is because I am nearly 30 now, and most of my life I have worked for minimum wage in NYC and can barely pay my rent, bills, expenses, etc. and would like to try and save some money by cutting my transportation costs by working from home. I currently work about 90-100 hours a week for $455/week, so I have no problem investing the same amount of work hours if the pay from home is going to be about the same, so that I will be saving money on commuting to work. However, most of the \"work from home!\" opportunities either 1) sound like scams, or 2) are not financially stable enough to depend on as an income. So is it viable to actually maintain a career from home, or am I pretty much stuck in my current employment position for the foreseeable future? Because I don't have any marketable job skills that employers will be wanting to pay more for, and also after I finish work and all my responsibilities are tended to, I don't have much time left over to invest in a new employable skill such as programming.",

        "question": "Should I pay more than the down payment for a house? My boyfriend and I have saved up $80k for a house (we get free housing/utilities from his job right now but he doesn't want to work it forever). Our target house would be $120k-130k. I know that the down payment would be approx. $24k-26k.\nWhen we're ready, what is the smartest move? Will a homeowner offer a discount for an all cash offer? Or should we pay for only the down payment, have some money for savings, and take out a loan?\nFyi I have a 765 credit score.",
        "prediction": "Everyone has a different idea of what's smart. My solution was to borrow heavily (90% of purchase price+) with a 5% fixed interest rate over 25 years, and do improvements on the house to increase it's value.\nSo here are the options I'd consider:\n\n\nShop around for a good loan/good bank. Don't be scared to go for a FHA-type of loan if you're going for a first-time homeowner program. Ideally a 3% down would be great, but shop around\n\n\nBuy a mix of equity and interest. Meaning, take out the entire amount of the loan, and tell the bank you'll have a 5BR, 3BA, enclosed 2-car garage and study with granite countertops for the bottom dollar. Then, have him approve mortgage itself for 3BR and 1BA (because you're living there currently), and look around for a good contractor.\n\n\nDon't spend too much on the house itself. Getting the loan is an advantage for you, giving you a larger sum of money to draw from. Accessorizing will cost maybe 5% of the purchase price, so keep in mind that doing things like redoing the roof, closing in the garage, etc means no interest carried on that part of the loan. If done right, you can easily make some profit off of purchasing a house like that. And the increase to your credit score is instant, increased lender recommendations are bound to result.",

        "question": "Citi says it \"destroyed\" my deed-in-lieu and wants a non-contested foreclosure instead In 2012, I hired a lawyer to reach a DIL agreement with Citi, which had threatened to foreclose on my underwater home (in Miami, Fla.). DIL agreement was signed in 2012 and registered in court in 2013; foreclosure proceeding stopped. The deed was returned to Citi. \nCiti, however, continued to send me mortgage statements and never changed the title, which still shows under my name (even though Citi has continued to pay the taxes and insurance). I've tried repeatedly to get it straightened out. \nIn January (2015), Citi went back to my lawyer and said it had mistakenly \"destroyed\" the DIL and asked if I would agree to an uncontested foreclosure. I said no way since signing would put a foreclosure on my credit record and expose me to taxes on the forgiven debt (since the tax exemption law expired at close of 2014). Plus, I don't really own the home. Citi does. This was all recorded in court.\nDoes anyone have any idea what is going on here? Why would Citi want to push me to foreclosure on a house that I signed over to them in 2012/2013?\nIn case it matters, I moved out in 2012 because I was relocated by my company. A friend has been living there rent-free, keeping the property up. But, there's a chance I may be moving back in the near future and I could move back into the home if there's any advantage to me doing so.\nAny advice is appreciated.

        "question": "If I have debt, should I be saving anything? Say I have 15k in revolving credit card debt at an 11% APR.  Should I be focused on paying that off before I even consider contributing to a savings or 401k?  It doesn't seem like there is any investment out there where I could make 11% interest from and so the best investment I can make is to pay down my debts.  My employer does not match my 401k.\nI'm 28 and have a 200k mortgage and while I make an effort to pay down my credit card debt, I'll usually splurge and charge a handful of big expenses throughout the year and end up at the same place come tax time.  I want to start contributing to my retirement savings but based on my reasoning above it doesn't seem to make sense.  Would another option be to invest in property, since it's more liquid and could possible generate income if I've got renters who are paying more than my mortgage?  Even so, any invest is not likely to give the 11% return rate that debt reduction would.\nTL;DR; Am I right to pay off all my debts before I consider any investments?",
        "prediction": "My vote is yes. Put away 1-2 months worth of living expenses, set up small $100-250 automatic transfers to index funds, and for the rest, funnel absolutely all of your extra cash into the credit card debt. And figure out why you keep racking it up - look at whatever 'non-essentials' you've purchased and ask if they're going to be valuable to you a year from now.

        "answer_2": "\nWould another option be to invest in property, since it's more liquid\n\nNo. It's not more liquid.\n1) You can't just \"withdraw\" money from a house. You either sell it or you keep it.\n2) Selling takes time, effort, and money. Withdrawing money from a 401k just takes money. Since you likely won't need the entire amount of the house, the penalties from the 401k might actually be cheaper than the fees incurred from selling the house.\nAlso, do you get employer match on the 401k?\nPay off your credit cards aggressively. Then cut it up or freeze them in the freezer so you don't use them. Only buy something if you have cash for it.\nYou should not be saving anything besides a 6 month emergency fund. Most people say 3-6, but I think 6 is better if you own a house. You might have to do emergency repairs. And if you lose your income, you'll want a buffer since, again, a house is difficult to get rid of."

However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't be teaching them the value of a dollar.\nHere are some of my suggestions:\n1.) Implement a chore chart and reward system. The chore chart will be based on their abilities and ages. Each day, they have chores to complete, and at the end of the week if they have completed all of their chores, they receive their allowance. \n2.) Allowance can be age-based, but doesn't have to be. For example, I wouldn't feel the need to give a 5 year old $5 weekly. They would be content with a dollar. \n3.) Each child should have a savings account. When they get their weekly allowance, double it. They put the double into their savings account. \n4.) Teach them about the \"Parent Credit Plan\". This is a fake credit card system. They can borrow money from you, but they have to pay it back within x amount of time. If they're late, that's okay, but they either have to pay a late fee, or do an extra chore. \n5.) Once they are old enough to work, they should be. It's important to work in retail for many reasons, but one key reason is learning about money. Encourage them to continue to contribute to their savings account. Have them set up a checking account with direct deposit, and teach them to set up an automatic transfer to savings. \n6.)

However, I had to pay for my own shoes and he budgeted for me to pay for 2 lunches at school per week within the $42/month. It was $1.25 for lunch at the time. He also told me I could pack my own lunch for free whenever I wanted. Guess who started making a $30 pair of shoes last a year? Guess who stopped eating school lunches? Guess who started stockpiling money? Guess who has zero resentment for his parent 23 years later? I was able to start saving enough money to pay for my own computer. I was not responsible for \"rent\" or \"electric bill\" or food in general. I was responsible for a couple of items that children or pre-teens can certainly handle. I learned a valuable lesson. I have known how to save money since I was 11. I will be implementing a similar program with my kids when they appear to be ready.\nIn general, though, I do agree with the other comments on this thread that are talking about you giving them $20 and then taking back $15 for necessities you provide. I don't think that is the best idea. Give them the allowance, tell them what their allowance covers, and be strong to not give them extra money for those things included in the allowance. My parents would sometimes give me an advance on the next week's allowance when it got close to the next \"pay period,\" but I think they should have skimmed %5 off the top like a payday advance might.\nHow old are they?

I would like to set up something to pay for my daughters future. I'd be interested in hearing thoughts on a trust or college fund, anything to that degree.

Your withholding can change from paycheck to paycheck depending on how large the paycheck is - the amount withheld is calculated from IRS formulas and assumes each check is representative of your annual salary.  Thus, if one paycheck is larger because of OT or a bonus, you have more withheld because the formulas don't account for that being a one-time thing.\nTax owed is calculated from your annual wages/salary/tips as reported on your W-2.  If you've withheld more throughout the year than you owe  when you file, you get a refund.  If not, you might owe the IRS some money.\nThe bottom line is that you aren't taxed \"more\" if you get OT or a bonus, it's just withheld at a different rate.",

It should have been a 5 minute appointment. I had scheduled just a normal doctors visit and ultimately just had to get the work form signed which was the only thing that happened besides me again repeating symptoms I had and the doctor kept asking me questions.

From your story it looks like that you don't have much savings or cash on hand to have a big wedding, so you wanna keep it small. And for the relationship side of things, (in regards to saving money) you can hold off the wedding part, until you save up enough money to have the wedding you want.  \nI had friend who book an all inclusive wedding on a 7 day cruse. Total cost was around 10k -15k. It took care of the honey moon, the wedding, and everything else. Guests, if they wanted to come, had to book tickets, and rooms. Probably would get a special discount because of them being in the wedding party. Could be less, could be more, but it took care of everything and afterwards, they didn't have any debt because of it. \nKey point here is, have the wedding you want as long as you don't get in debt.

        "question": "The Best Financial Decision I Ever Made... I've been wanting to write this for awhile and figured with the recent market turmoil and people social distancing (redditing), now might be a good time to reach some open minds.\nReal Estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion in this sub so please consider if this isn't for you, it doesn't mean it's not helpful to someone. This post is for anyone that is willing to consider real estate as part of their portfolio.\nI'm talking about holding physical real estate with a bank loan or mortgage. If that's not for you, consider REITs. Personally, I don't own any REITs since I own physical real estate but they have consistently proved to be less volatile and more profitable than total market indexes. [Average REIT Returns vs Stocks Over Long Periods]( \nIn truth, physical real estate is one of the most powerful and accessible tools for people with common jobs to build wealth. I don't need to rehash why, as hundreds of articles have done before. [Why Real Estate Builds Wealth More Consistently Than Other Asset Classes]( \nLastly, below's an illustration of a recent change I made that I hope resonates with the younger FIRE community. I went from living in a shared 2-bedroom apartment to a one-bedroom apartment, and am saving an extra $1296 per month doing it. How so? I invested $62k and bought a multi-family home, living in one unit and renting out the other 3. Don't have $62k for a down payment? You probably qualify for a FHA loan for 3.5% down. Below is my expense breakdown for the first month of ownership. My only regret is not doing it sooner... and cashing on in the current 3% 30-year fixed mortgage.\n[ \nThere's lots of advice about churning credit cards, cut out cable, reduce their cellphone bill, etc for a few hundred bucks a year. What about looking at your unused or underutilized assets. In this real estate focused post, that could mean renting out and extra room or garage.\nWhile I love my VTSAX for it's simplicity and returns, I expect this investment will have 2-4x the returns of VTSAX and add diversification to my portfolio.",

        "answer_1": "You say \"real estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion\" like it's some sort of conspiracy against real estate.\nReal estate is a great option, but it tends to be irrationally overhyped and backed up by shady numbers. Your post, unfortunately, isn't much of an exception. Anyone saying that ANY investment will have 2x4x the returns of VTSAX over the long term is selling snake oil.\nBut also some of the monthly numbers fall into the same traps that I see over an over again:\n\nThey compare leveraged RE numbers versus unleveraged equity numbers.\nThey don't include time costs\nThey either don't include maintenance costs or vastly underestimate them.\nThe don't include risks of evictions, non-payment, and vacancies. (This is one of the things that worries me the most. People who cannot pay the mortgage without the rental income are people who will get into serious trouble sooner or later.)\nThey make very optimistic assumptions about rental income rates. It varies market to market, but most rental rates aren't going to cover mortage+tax+insurance, let alone mortgage+tax+insurance+maintenance+transaction costs+capital costs. Active real estate investment is a generally a long game where your eventual profit comes via capital gains and rent increases.\n\nAgain, let me be 100% clear, I am not against real estate investing. I just think that it is often portrayed with very rose colored glasses on investment boards. Sure, if you can find an excellent property, with excellent tenants, and excellent appreciation you will make out great. But, just like stocks, not every pick is a winner and it's harder to get diversification when owning properties directly.

        "question": "I want to move my savings from one bank to another, how do I decide which bank is best? I'm 22, finishing up college with no student loans or any debt due to scholarship. I had the privilege of being able to work jobs in my field throughout college and summers (including Co-ops) and have all that money go straight into my savings account.\nFor the past ~6 years, whenever I have had more than $800 in my checking account, I move the difference into my savings. Now that I am graduating, it's sitting at about $20,000. I set up the savings account when I got into college, and I don't really understand it. For example, I moved $3000 into it at the beginning of January and the next day I got $6.24 in interest on 1/24. I moved another $450 over a few days later and on 2/24 I got $7.33 in interest. I haven't moved any money over since then, and on 3/24 got $0.83 in interest. I use a Southern regional bank called BancorpSouth... I love them because they're really good with security (I get calls about my own purchases saying \"this isn't like you, can you authorize this?\" or \"we don't have any indication you would be making a purchase in this state, can you authorize this?\" just from going two states over). However when I've traveled out of the South, sometimes I haven't had access to an ATM without crazy fees, so I feel like I need a more nationally (& internationally) available bank.\nI'm inherently frugal and hard working, but never really paid attention to finances. I feel like I need to put all this savings into one of those compound interest kind of accounts. \nSo I guess my questions are:\n\n\nWhat bank should I open a savings account with? What kind of plan?\n\n\nHow do you transfer money this way? Do I like... write myself a check, and take it to the other bank??\n\n",
        "prediction": "For savings, looking at fees is your biggest factor.  The interest rate is complicating that number, but probably on the far end of the priority list.  I'm not a fan of virtual banks, but there is one thing they are damn good at...  I'll give you 3 recommendations:\n1) Capital One 360.  Formerly ING Direct.  They have ATMs but are far and away the best out there.  No fees, no minimums, and 1.20% interest right now.  Signing up takes maybe the time it takes to fill out the application and it's up and going.\n2) Ally Bank.  I don't know if they are still doing this, but they had 1.0% interest and were going to raise it to 1.20% or 1.25% after the first 6 months.  No fees, no minimums.\n3) Discover Bank.  I think their interest rate is slightly lower than Capital One/Ally, but they have a great rep.  Also no fees, no minimums.\nAs tempting as it is, having too many accounts can get messy.  I get $1-2/month to transfer between accounts to avoid fees.  That's actually not that bad because it acts like a small emergency fund.  If you really want to consolidate, there may be a decent option but there will be trade-offs involved.  \nAs far as transfers go, I'm not sure.  Capital One has Nickname Accounts, which cannot be included in the same sign up application as other accounts.  My guess is you get an existing Capital One checking account, which can't be closed unless you cancel the whole account, and then do a transfer.  It may be a pain, but I've transferred money different banking accounts for free so it is actually kind of simple.  All of quick $ in $ out denomination accounts are Federally Insured Accounts, which is the only type of banking account you should get.  And before anyone says Credit Union's are always the way to go, I have a great credit union.  When you factor in bank fees, interest rates, and cash back on credit cards my credit union is far from the best option.  Your money is your money, it's not going to grow much, the small differences in monthly routine fees will drown out any interest differences.  You spec'd about $40/year in fee difference.  That isn't even enough to cancel a .25% check on 1K, so don't worry about that.\nSo those are my three recommendations.  If you don't feel OK transferring money between accounts, you may be stuck.  Good luck.",

Come to find out, this house is going into foreclosure (the bank delivered some paperwork here from the loan remediation dept and my friend who does mortgages was able to somehow look up the house online and find out that the owners are in fact in default on their loan- public records, she didn't do anything shady).  I mail my landlord the rent each month.

        "question": "My long term girlfriend has 65k+ in student loans, most of which her parents took out and used themselves The loans range from 3% - 8%. The high interest ones are the ones that her parents took out and account for about 2/3's of the debt.  Currently she is living at home and is making about 60k a year but has to commute from 1 hour to 1 and a half hours. I have checked some websites and believe that you cannot consolidate Stafford Parent Loans.  Please correct me if I am wrong. \nSo basically she is paying her parents loans first (due to high interest) before attempting to tackle hers. She knows that her parents probably used some of that money for their own purposes but she is still willing to pay for it. Her parents aren't in the best financial shape but has a lot of money overseas if only they asked one of their relatives for it. (technically it was suppose to be one of the parent's but he/she decided to let their relative keep it).\nI do want to marry this girl someday but her debt is not something I look forward to.\nWould it be possible to take a lower interest loan and pay off the parent's debt?

It sucks to have terrible parents who would victimize their child like this, but enabling them by ignoring it will help no one.\nDid she pay for a substantial portion of her education? There does not need to be much mystery here. If she did not, she just needs to do some basic math.\nTotal Cost of Education - Scholarships - Grants - Amount She Paid= Amount Paid For With Loans\nIf that number is 65k+, then it went to finance her education. \nIf she is living at home, she should utilize almost her entire paycheck every month to pay it off in about 2 years.",

I also have a home equity line of credit used for improvements at about $60,000.

Don't sell. if you sell home in August, cash offer by Sept 1. After realtor fees, close of escrow costs, and taxes on 250K, your monthly payment is still 1940 (assuming you stuck with 30 year, probably on a higher rate), and your rate will be 267,050 (assuming 3.25% - how do I know?

The equity in your current home is useless in the initial purchase (although it can be great for a subsequent refi). I would save it in a high-yield savings account, or possibly in CDs (with maturity planned for when you'll start house hunting).\nA five year time horizon puts a lot of risk on an investment - it's not long enough to ensure that it doesn't temporarily lose significant value by the time you need it. I do think that, any longer, and that risk drops off quickly, but five is about the ceiling of what I would consider to be a \"short term investment\"."

The others then picked up her portion of the rent.  Then they were late on rent one month (according to them) and their landlord sent them an eviction notice.

I would like to purchase car but don't know the rule of thumb for what I can afford. I currently make 3,360 a month after taxes and have about 1,000 in living expenses. 5,000 in savings. No debt or loans. Any advice would be appreciated thanks.  ",
        "prediction": "The general idea is that you shouldn't exceed 15% of your monthly disposable income (after taxes and costs) in your monthly car payment. \nIn your case, you can probably afford a $816 - $837 total payment per month. This will be all your costs though - loan, tags, insurance, maintenance. The actual payment will be much less than this - just budget in extra here to be safe. \nDown payment will likely drastically reduce the cost of your monthly payments.",
        "answer_1": "a common rule of thumb for car buying is the 20-4-10 rule.\n\nminimum 20% down payment\nmaximum 4 year loan term\nmonthly car expenses (payments, insurance, fuel, maintenance, parking ,etc) must be less than 10% of your net monthly income\n",
        "answer_2": "I make close to that net and my car payment is about $415. My expenses are higher than yours, but I still put away about 30% of my income, so I don't feel pinched by it. If it was any higher I would feel uncomfortable."

        "question": "How can I help my wife understand that having money is not a bad thing? A bit of background, my wife was a teenager during the recession, and her family was hit pretty hard since her dad works as a real estate appraiser. They went from having a really comfortable life to having nothing for several years. There were a lot of nights they went hungry. But despite their troubles they never turned to anyone for help, and it's kind of a point of pride for them. Additionally, even when things were going well, they didnt live like they were rich and were very frugal, also another thing my wife is proud of. \nBut now my wife has this mentality where she is afraid of me making too much money. She is afraid of saving/investing too much. Because of the way she grew up, she has it in her head that having more than enough money is somehow bad. My desires for having greater wealth is to 1. Provide for our own family and live comfortably 2. Use the excess to help others and save for the future needs of our children and grandchildren. I'm not planning to drive a brand new car or buy my wife pearl earrings, but I want to earn as much as I can so we can do as much good as possible. Despite this, my wife still gets really nervous when I talk about how much money I might be making after school and when I get financial help books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\nDoes anyone have any advice on what I can do to help my wife not be afraid of having more money than we need to survive? ",
        "prediction": "The way you help her to understand that is actually pretty simple: draw up a list of all the horrible things that happened to her family due to the documented consumption of her father's pay check, and how in order to fix the problem, they had to use massive amounts of their savings.\nThen make a list if how much those disasters would have cost, but how they would have been totally avoidable if her dad had had a better home workspace, an college fund for her and her siblings, an emergency fund, etc, etc, etc, etc on hand. And ask her how much cheaper those assets would have cost then their current equivalent.\nFinally, check how much would a 30 year mortgage on time cost, versus a 5 year mortgage payment save them. And long term sum it up.\nOnce she understands that a healthy savings and investments fund is cheaper then the cost of trying to catch up on the mess, she should be okay.",

That is one of the \u201cmoney scripts\u201d, that money is bad and evil, and virtuous people do not have or seek it.\nAnother money script is that money solves every problem. A third is that money = success.\nTime to find a savvy therapist or financial coach and work through these issues. Also, to examine your own assumptions about money.",
        "answer_2": "Help her realize that the saving and conservatively investing is going to keep you from getting close to that edge again, whereas not having it means you\u2019ll be on that brink forever, one crisis away from the same lifestyle again. \nMoney issues, I\u2019ve found, change people in ways that are phenomenally deep and hard to change.

        "prediction": "A lot of variables need to be considered. Marketplace, interest rate, age of the marketplace, risk vs return, etc. Generally, the younger marketplace is, the higher the risk, but the higher the reward. Earlier marketplaces have the track record in assessing risk of borrowers.",
        "answer_1": "It may well be an excellent addition to a diversified portfolio. Personally though I won't touch it until it's gone through at least one crisis-and-subsequent-regulation cycle. At the top of my mind:\n\n\nWhile some P2P companies are actually P2P, most look a lot like banks. They allow investors to deposit/withdraw money very quickly, while the loans they make are for multiple years. This plus a lack of regulation (and associated capital requirements) makes me nervous.\n\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the companies have 'provision funds' which compensate investors in the case some of their loans default. These funds typically run to a few percentage points of the loans made. This seems like something that will fail spectacularly in bad times, and some companies have strange protocols on what to do when that happens.\n\n\nMany of the companies are looking to seize as much market share as possible, and I suspect this will drive them to silently lower the creditworthiness of their lendees. Look at how the sale of MBS drove banks to give mortgages to people who really shouldn't have had mortgages.\n\n\nHere's a good article that details a lot of the issues:",
        "answer_2": "No.\nHere's why:\nBasically, P2P lending is high risk for the lender and the interest rates demanded reflect that reality.  Additionally, interest rates can be jacked up (oh, you might be promised (\"as much as\") a 10% return, but the actual interest rate could be as high as 20%, which is in payday loan territory).  The main problem with P2P lending is what happens at default.  Usually the organizing company tells you \"sorry, better luck next time, now fuck off and here's how to write it off on your taxes\".  Meanwhile, they go after the debtor over the long term to recover \"their\" money, of which you will never see a dime.  The second failure mode is that they stick their snout into the borrower's cash flow via factoring agreements in the contract at the first missed payment.  They then settle your half of the loan at a below par rate (you were promised \"as much as 10%\", but they report the missed payment, say the borrow is in default and give you 2%... you should just be happy you got your money+2% back... meanwhile they're consistently extracting 7% each month via factoring)."

The neighboring duplex has exactly the same layout.  The owners inherited the property, and they haven't raised rents in the past decade, from before the neighborhood became desirable.  Currently the rents are $700 for the 2/1 and $550 for the 1/1.  \nIf I end up buying the place, I'd obviously want to get the rents to a market rate.  I've chatted with the tenants, while I was renovating my duplex.  (I actually got the owner's number from one of the tenants.)  They are very nice people, and they've lived there for 12 and 15 years, respectively.  I feel pretty bad for raising rents by 80%, but gradually raising would take forever to get to a market rate.

        "answer_1": "It depends.  most of the time the owner is separate from the company so their personal belongings aren't subject to the bankruptcy.  In some cases an owner of a business won't do this.\nExample.  You make cupcakes.  You buy a little store, hire 2 people to help and sell cupcakes out of that store.  You probably had to take out a loan to get that store, maybe cupcakes aren't selling great and you can't keep up on your employee's paychecks.  Eventually the business just isn't making enough money and you can't afford the electric bill (can't keep the lights on) and close the business.\nWhat about all that money you owe?  Maybe a few months on utilities.  Maybe rent/mortgage payments for the property, maybe the last paycheck for employees?  Well you are on the hook for all of that, and can't afford it so you declare bankruptcy.  you couldn't afford it so you just tell everyone \"I don't have the money to pay you\" and all (well, most) of your debt is forgiven.  You have to pay what you can but certain things you own are protected (your home almost always, often a car ect ect).\nNow if you make cupcakes and decide to open a cupcake store you could make Cupcakes LLC or Cupcakes INC.  Then the company you created would buy/rent the store, would pay your employees and bills.  And if the company ran out of money and declared bankruptcy, your bank account is safe because you didn't declare bankruptcy, the company did.\nIn the first example you own the ingredients, you own the store, you own the equipment.  In the second example you own Cupcakes LLC, but Cupcakes LLC is what owns the ingredients/store/equipment.",

Does anyone have a favorite long term bond ETF they would recommend researching?",
        "prediction": "Bonds pay interest regularly, are highly liquid, and principal is paid back at the end of its term. These three factors make bonds appear less sexy to some than stocks but they are useful in constructing a portfolio due to the regular passive income they provide and the liquidity of bonds when you need money.\nA good bond is one of quality (a strong balance sheet), duration (the time until it matures), and value in the current marketplace relative to market movements. \nI like [Vanguard's lifespan bond etf]( ",
        "answer_1": "High credit quality bonds dont have nearly as much donwside (potential loss in nominal value) than stocks, and at the same time provide a promised, 'fixed' coupon at a certain price. (hence the name fixed income investments). \nThe appeal of adding bonds to your portfolio is providing a (lower) relatively stable income that is not highly correlated with the gains generated from stocks (it can be for periods of time, like the 2010-2012 recovery bull-market for the US).  \nThe end result is that the overall portfolio has now achieved \na) a shorter downfall potential in the event of an overall market downturn and \nb) a higher risk-adjusted return, by reducing the correlations between assets and moving the portfolio closeer to being an \"efficient portofolio\" in the sense that it provides the highest return for each unit of risk assumed (traditional finance uses volatility as a proxy for this, not a perfect choice but that's a whole different topic)\nWhat makes a bond good/attracctive? In short, a bond is a credit promise, you want the highest yield, with the lowest level of risk, this is where credit analysis comes in. Bonds are by far the largest asset class when you consider the many types Gov't + Corporate bonds that exist, but in order to keep this short, you want high credit quality (ability to make timely promised payments in terms agreed) and higher yeild. \nNaturally this an inverse relationship in which bond traders (including computers using HFT) are looking for value by buying 'cheap' bonds, most commonly used metric would be the spread relative to its credit rating, which is a measure of credit quality given by he ratings agencies. The spread would be the distance in percentage bassis points that a particular bond you're looking into trades from their peers, so, assuming everything else is the same among the peer group, you're looking for the higher spread (highest yielding bond). The peer group is usually based on credit rating.  Note that the natural relationship is that the lower the rating, the higher the yeild. \nBonds are a whole particular universe and a larger chapter of finance. [It is definetely worth taking up a look, and this could be a good place to start to read about credit quality, credit ratings, interest rate risk and spreads.]( \nAs for ETFs, depending on the riskiness of bonds you seek for your portfolio, you could use a variety of things. Vanguard's BLV tracks the performance of the Barclays U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index. \nAdding bond exposure is also a good way to 'anchor' your portfolio or parking some cash, though keep in mind the main risks all bond face are interest rate risks, as their yields are worth less once the risk free rate rises, and hence they're expected to lose value once/when the FED raises rates. \nThe main thing you should take away from this is that it is almost always a good idea to add at least SOME bonds to your portoflio to anchor your portfolio, and improve its risk adjusted return by providing a steadier base and relatively lower, abut also steadier income than stocks. \nYou can find [tons of bond ETF that are long/short on different typees of bonds here](  It will mostly be a matter of how much to add to it, and what level of risk you want in your bonds. \nThe old adage (not very scientific butt provides a ballpark figure) is to have a portoflio mix of (100%- AGE%) in stocks and the rest in bonds, e.g if you're 30, that would be 70% stocks, 30% bonds. I hope this helps as a start. Good luck with your reading!",
        "answer_2": "Current teaching is to consider all income streams when calculating asset mix, ie, both your human and financial capital. If you work a job that pays a salary without much fluctuation, or in other words, acts like a fixed income investment, then you're safe to be 100% stocks. For example, if you're a 25 year old accountant who gets paid the same salary each year, that fixed income stream for the next 35 years discounted to present value is far larger than any sum of money you could invest today. So you are already 99% weighted to fixed income, so feel free to put it all in stocks. Its later down the road when you save up half a million dollars that the weights start to change.\nHowever if you work a job that has pay more correlated with the market, like an investment banker, you're better off putting a good chunk of money in bonds, because you already have equity capital market exposure in your salary/bonus pay.\nNote: This assumes a lot of things, not to be taken completely at face value, as each persons' finances are unique."

        "question": "Confused with Roth IRAs... I just had a discussion with someone over whether or not I should open a Roth IRA. I think it's a good idea to squirrel away as much as I need for retirement along with my 401k, but she suggests saving the money instead for a down payment on a house (which I don't plan on buying for the next 10-20 years, if at all). \nHer logic is instead of paying just capital gains tax if I held it outside of an account and cashing it in, if I held it in a Roth IRA I'd pay capital gains tax plus the 10% penalty on earnings.\nHelp me r/personalfinance. \n\nShould I start saving for a down payment for a house or squirreling it in a Roth IRA? \nShould I even touch the Roth for anything other than retirement?\nIf not, how should I save for a large expense that's at least 10 years down the line but with no certainty as to when it will happen?\n",
        "prediction": "\nher logic is instead of paying just capital gains tax if I held it outside of an account and cashing it in, if I held it in a Roth IRA I'd pay capital gains tax plus the 10% penalty on earnings.\n\nThe 10% penalty is a red herring in this case.  The $6k annual Roth limit isn't flexible to make up for \"unforeseen\" mortgage down payments many years down the road.  If you withdraw some principal + earnings, you don't have the room to put it back as a contribution so you're double taxed on the earnings.  That's an important thing to keep in mind when designing your retirement-plan-portfolio.\nOpening a Roth and regularly withdrawing \"principal only\" is a fine documented strategy, especially since you don't have to withdraw in order of earnings unless you already have outstanding outstanding contributions.  So your plan might be to invest $6k principal+earnings every year, but only keep a small percent as cash as necessary to cover your short-term needs.  The accumulated college money would stay in the Roth until you figured out what to do with it.",
        "answer_1": "\nShould I start saving for a down payment for a house or squirreling it in a Roth IRA?\n\n10 to 20 years is a long time away and the tax laws may change. At the moment, however, you may withdraw up to $10,000 from your IRA for a down payment on a home. This is for \"first-time home buyers,\" which is a loose term that actually means \"anyone who has not owned a home in the last 2 years.\"\n[Source]( \n\nShould I even touch the Roth for anything other than retirement?\n\nA Roth IRA is an amazingly versatile savings vehicle. Because your contributions are post-tax, you can withdraw the entirety of your contributions at any time, without condition, tax-free. If you put $5,000 in your Roth IRA this month, you're free to pull out $5,000 next month without consequence.\nYou may not, however, pull out any earnings from your Roth IRA until you reach retirement age (59 1/2)^1. Still, it's a great deal: tax-free growth and the option to use the principal as an additional emergency fund. It should probably not be used as your main emergency fund, because your Roth investments are likely to be riskier than cash holdings.\n[Source]( \n\nIf not, how should I save for a large expense that's at least 10 years down the line but with no certainty as to when it will happen?\n\nIf you already have a 6 month emergency fund, I see no reason not to invest your \"downpayment\" into a Roth IRA. Especially because your career may increase your income down the line and make you ineligible for a Roth, it's good to open one early in your career. I get the impression you're starting out since you are uncertain if you'll be settling down or purchasing a property in the near future.\nI think Roth is the best option, but if you'd rather not, you could always look into [laddering CDs]( ^2 or high interest checking accounts.\nI have a 3% high interest checking account and just opened another 4% interest checking account. You have to meet certain requirements, such as a minimum number of debit transactions each month. Google \"high interest checking\" to search for an account you can apply to, either in your local city/state or online.\nBest of luck, hope that helps.\n1: Except certain special situations, such as the first-time home buyer situation, as stated explicitly by commenters below.\n2: Unfortunately, CD interest rates have dropped significantly since this article came out. Rates are hovering around 1% and change. The basic methodology is still sound, however.",
        "answer_2": "IMO, your retirement savings should be separate from your down payment savings.  I'm not sure of your yearly earnings, but I'd advise that you participate in 401K if your company provides a match.  Then fund a Roth IRA with up to $5K.

However, are there any added benefits with doing it straight with Vanguard?",
        "prediction": "Scottrade and Vanguard are both reputable brokerages. Your question about whether to go directly with Vanguard is an interesting one that comes up frequently. My view is this:\nPros when going directly through Vanguard:\n\nPotential lower fees if you hold money in a non-IRA account above $10,000 ($50 per year with Scotia, $20-50 with Vanguard)\nVanguard\u2019s customer service is more hands-on than Scotia.\nIf you plan on doing a lot of investing in Vanguard funds, an account directly with Vanguard is quicker and more straightforward. Buying through Scotia requires that Scotia goes to Vanguard to purchase the ETF, and sell it again when you sell.\nSome Vanguard funds are listed only on Vanguard\u2019s website, and C$ purchases go through a different bank than U.S. purchases.\n\nCons going through Vanguard:\n\nWhen you have a non-trade account and a Mutual Fund account, you will have to log into two different accounts to index your Mutual Funds and to index your ETF portfolio. Since I am doing a lot of non-taxable weighting (bond index funds), I dislike having to log into two accounts.\nVanguard\u2019s interface is worlds better than Scotia\u2019s, particularly when it comes to reports. \nThe lack of synchronization between Vanguard and Scotia could lead to inefficiencies. For example: if you want to lighten your bond fund in Scotia and rebalance your stock fund at Vanguard, you need buy and sell at divergent prices unless you execute the trades simultaneously. \nScotia provides tax-loss harvesting if you sell ETFs in a non-registered account while purchasing a similar security, and offset the gains to your credit. I do not believe Vanguard currently offers these features.\nScotia can more readily purchase stocks from individual countries in your ETF portfolio on request. I am not sure about what Vanguard may be like here. \nScotia Research tracks stocks more effectively than Vanguard MFs, though these insights may go away after the shift to the non-advisor branch. \nThe U.S. government doesn't treat Vanguard accounts held by Canadians and Canadians less favorably than account holders in the U.S. They will blame the performing currency and tax exemptions for the soundness of the Funds, and the Canadian market as inconsequential enough for them to ignore both at least for now.\n\nUltimately, you should decide based on your own personal situation.

This gives you the continued expense ratio of the ETF with the flexibility of the mutual fund (no more bid/ask spreads, no more having to buy whole shares).

The others do separate projections depending on when your time period starts in the historical data- sometimes being back as far as the 1800s, for example. So the Vanguard tool is based just on a \"backtest\" of how the various portfolio options would have fared been in the past going back about 100+ years.\nGetting older portfolio data requires larger samples, as it is quite difficult to get an accurate idea of how a portfolio would do/ amount of gains it would have over time. \nBy only going back 100-ish years and then making projections from there, it's an incomplete data set for making a truly calculated \"guess\".

        "prediction": "Step 1: Full emergency fund. $1200 is probably a good start for you. $2000-$3000 would be your emergency fund goal.\nStep 2: Roth IRA. Put as much into it as you can handle. #1 Asset class to invest in: Vanguard Total Stock Market, lower the allocation of it if the market goes down. Rebalance year - end. ($6000/year).\nStep 3: Extra savings. Add any extra savings into this account. (+ compound interest = dope).\nStep 4: Read the three books here:  \nAdditionally, no one likes a cheap person, but been a grad student going through school caused me to realize how important having a true budget and managing my money is. I use Mint personally, they seem kinda stupid simple, but the mint amount that I got from it helped me save $1200 off of my car payment this month (I foreclosed on my account and saved that person's credit, instead of charging $70 (yeah $70 and indexable rate of 21-25%) per month :P)",
        "answer_1": "Since this is the first $1200 you have saved up, you probably don't want to invest it in the stock market. Instead, you want to use it as your emergency fund.\nYou describe yourself as a \"broke girl\", but you're not anymore! Broke people live paycheck to paycheck. They make money, and then spend it immediately. They're close to being broke again by the time they get their next paycheck.\nTake that $1200 and promise yourself that you will NEVER live paycheck to paycheck. Always have enough to be one paycheck ahead. And then make it two paychecks ahead. Eventually you want to get to the point where you are about 3 months ahead.\nOnce you have that 3 month buffer, you can start investing money (probably in a Roth IRA, using a target date fund or total market index funds). If you work for a company with a 401k, you'll want to contribute enough to get the full company match. But right now focus on building that buffer.\nThe reason for this buffer is that life is complicated. Unexpected things happen. Your car breaks down. Your pet gets sick. For someone who lives paycheck to paycheck, any unexpected bill is a disaster. But for you, it's not an disaster anymore! You just take your savings and pay off the unexpected bill. Think of your emergency fund as your superpower. You become stronger, tougher, and more resilient than people who live paycheck to paycheck. \nI'm not sure if you can open your own bank accounts at 17, but once you turn 18, you'll want to keep most of your emergency fund in a savings account that pays you around 2% interest or more. (Lots of online banks like Ally and Discover have good interest rates. But the megabanks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo will rip you off by paying you 0.1% interest or less).",

Any private student loans she has are not eligible.\nWhen the loans are discharged, she will get a tax bill. The discharge of debt is considered income under the tax code. If she's currently paying less than the interest accumulating, this could end up being a very significant bill.\nPresumably she's on IBR, which means as her income rises, the amount she's required to pay will also rise.\nMarriage will affect her payment amounts if you file your taxes jointly.

        "prediction": "\ncredit unions - member owned ;are usually smaller institutions. Full-service counterpart to banks.  Pros: lower account fees, lower loan rates, often higher savings rates, better customer service and member experience than big banks.  Cons: fewer branch locations and ATMs, fewer online banking services/tools, fewer product offerings when compared to huge national banks, lower interest on money market accounts, higher minimum opening deposit required to open an account than big banks, limited products for businesses\nbanks- sometimes customer owned ; usually larger institutions. Offer a more extensive range of financial products and services than credit unions. Pros: more branches/ATMs, more online banking options.  Cons: been punished by consumers for persistant caused scandals and unethical sales practices (opening lines of credit for customers without their permission), higher account fees, higher rates on loans, lower levels of customer service\n\n\nThere are definitely advantages to each. Banks just offer more products/services but there's probably a credit union branch/ATM somewhere in your neighborhood that will meet most of your banking needs.  I had accounts with two major banks in the past and I often hated dealing with customer service. I found many of the non-military credit unions have more personalized account options/products, like low interest loans if you have to make a large purchase or reverse mortgages.   \nMy credit union has a community focus and doesn't charge fees on checking/savings accounts and earns money through their mortgage arm and business operations.",
        "answer_1": "You are an owner in the credit union.  You are not an owner in the bank.\nThe credit union keeps costs low so their products and services are often more limited.

        "answer_2": "This is from my own very limited experience, comparing my wife's credit union and the major regional bank where I have my deposit account.\n\nMy bank has a much better online platform than her credit union.  The credit union actually uses a third party site just to offer PDFs of account statements.  My bank's site can initiate ACH transfers, pay bills online, and much more.  My wife's credit union cannot.\nHer credit union's loan offerings are much more limited.  Mortgages are capped at $350,000.  (That's an irrelevant restriction for us because in our location, that's enough for plenty of house, but it would be tough in San Francisco.)  In addition, they do not offer points on mortgages or many other forms of loan product flexibility.  But the rates are pretty reasonable and they don't charge origination fees (in fact, they even ponied up extra cash towards closing costs for our mortgage).\nHer credit union's depositor-service offerings are more limited, too.  They don't even offer an ATM card or credit card.  Getting direct deposit set up was easy enough, but the only way we've ever made an actual withdrawal has been by sending an email to an actual human being at the credit union to authorize the transfer, which was verified by a return phone call placed to us.  No online funds transfers, no actual branches where one can walk in and withdraw money, and like I said, no debit or credit cards.  I don't even think they offer checks.  We certainly don't have any.\nThe current dividend on shares (equivalent of interest) at the credit union is 0.75%.  At my bank, it's 0.25%.  Of course, both of those are lousy, that's just what interest rates are like right now.  But the combination of the fact that (a) it's easy to get money into the credit union (many people at the Fortune 500 company it's associated with simply have a portion of their paychecks automatically deposited there), (b) it's a little bit harder to access once it's there, and (c) it earns at least a little bit more interest while it's there, means that she and most of her coworkers use the credit union as a savings account or a place to put some money away little by little to build up for major purchases, while using a more traditional bank for everyday cash management needs.\nHer credit union largely ignored some black marks on her credit history when she applied for a loan.  We were denied for a mortgage loan by two local banks because of her credit.  I don't think her credit union even pulled her score.\nHer credit union approves loans with dramatically less paperwork than traditional banks.  As in, the total volume of forms for our mortgage was four pages.\nHer credit union is dramatically less leveraged than almost any bank I've heard of.  They release their figures monthly, in a newsletter that looks like the local high school newspaper editor did it in his spare time.  In September, they had about $170M in deposits (shares) and $30M in outstanding loans.  Bank executives would probably be on the verge of getting fired if they were so risk-averse.  Usually those numbers will be flipped and more in the commercial banking world.\n\nI'm sure that there are other credit unions that are nothing like my wife's company's, and I'm sure there are plenty of regular for-profit banks out there that have antiquated tech as well.  But those are the differences I've noticed.  And for the record, I'm pretty happy with both my bank and her credit union, and I'm glad that the overall financial landscape in this country is such that there's room for both."

        "question": "I just got a new car and had to put 95% of my savings down on it and also had to take on a really high APR So, I recently got my license and, shortly after, decided to go get a car. I went to my local Honda dealer looking for a car I had already found online. Once I found out it was there, I was pretty much already at the point of being sold on it. It was a Honda Civic 2016 LX with only 36,777 miles and no issues or past accidents for $13,677.\nI got with a representative and we started talking about my car credit. Well, I had absolutely no car credit, since this would be my first financed car, so the guy told me I would have to put a larger amount down on the car. I originally came in with the intention of only putting down $2,000 max out of my $3,580 in savings down on the car. So, when I said $1,500 and the guy asked if I could put $2,000 instead to increase my chances of getting a loan, I was a little discouraged but understanding since I had no credit and I really wanted this deal. The guy then walks to the back to give this information to the banks. After about 20 minutes, he comes back and asks if I could put down $2,500. I start getting a little annoyed at this point, but I agreed none the less. He walks to the back and I wait about another 20 minutes. The guy comes back and, this is when I get really freaked out, he says that the bank is willing to give me a loan, but I would have to put down $3,500. I sat there for a solid minute to think this one out, but I really wanted to get a car to start a new job I've been looking at for a while and I didn't want to die in a junker vehicle, so ultimately I decided to go for it. I was getting my paycheck in a few days anyways and I live with my father, so it didn't seem like too much of a risk. Once I'm signing papers, I end up getting to the part where I see my APR and loan term. This is where my bum is starting to feel a little sore. It was a 6 year loan with a 25% APR. And so now, I have a car that ended up being $25,000 instead of $13,677. \nWith my position right now, I feel like I can manage the payments, but what I'm asking here is: Is there a better way to handle this loan now with the circumstances? Should I try to get a co-signer to lower the APR and payments? If so, could I do it with my current loan, or should I refinance? If I do that, do I refinance now, or in two years? Are there other ways to clean up this mess?\nAny input would be appreciated here.",

Ideally you'd try soon, as hopefully you don't owe more than the vehicle is worth.

        "answer_2": "You knew something was wrong after the multiple requests to put more down but went through with it anyway.  It's odd how car dealerships do this to people (my dad is a sucker at the car dealer however not this bad).  Personally I would sell the car.

One I got in October of last year - the other one I've had since April.  The job I've had since April is now offering me full time which comes with a hourly wage almost equal to the first job with a whole ton of awesome benefits as well.  So I definitely want to do that instead of continuing to work 60+ hours a week.\nIn the past I have always used the two-week notice as a professional courtesy.  This job that I want to quit now though - only giving a two-week notice would almost undoubtedly screw them.  I only have 4 other co-workers in my \"department\" and we are split among 3 zones and are all part-time with other jobs.  Zones in this context is just cities and towns in about a 50 mile radius.  One of these zones is solely my responsibility.  I work with clients in my zone who I meet with during my workday.  I have clients booked up with me throughout the next 3 months.\nTo do my job requires me to be certified by the state and involves at least a month of training alone and then some for paperwork, etc.  So me quitting would mean a scramble to hire someone else who would undoubtly need to be trained to get certified before they could even start to take over for me.  I think this could take my employer 2 months or more to do.\nBut I really don't want to keep working this job for all that to happen.  I don't really have any bad feelings for my employer; I'm just in a position to have something better right now.. That is just how it goes.  However, that being said; I'm offered absolutely no benefits from this employer and I believe I am being paid $2-$5/hr less than my co-workers (which would put them at or around $20/hr).  But even if they offered me a good bump in pay I still wouldn't see it as worth it compared to being full time at the other job and having a better work-life balance.\nIf I wasn't so worried about feeling guilty I would just give my two weeks, be done and not worry about leaving them high and dry.  But I'm typically not that type of person.  So I want to give my employer the option of keeping me a little bit longer and instead giving a 1-2 month notice or some sort of staggered leave where they could continually reduce my schedule over a set time period (like 3 months).\nHowever, if I gave them an option like that, I would kinda want them to make it \"worth my while.\"  I just wouldn't have any idea how to bring that up without sounding like an absolute scumbag.\nShould just skip all that and just give them a 2-3 week notice and leave them to figure their own shit out?  Or should I offer to stay longer if they work something out with me?  If so how should I go about brining that up?\nAnd just to be clear- I'm not trying to take advantage of a situation to pry money out of the employer...

I have developed a simple strategy that combines instantaneous reviews of current markets with a conceptual view of economic history.\nI believe this is called the \"Buffet Principle of Passive Income.\" After reading this sub I believe I got it figured out.",
        "answer_1": "Median U.S. income currently stands at $56,516 - rounding that to $60k we can thus calculate (with some highly simplistic assumptions) using historic return numbers that generating this amount from investment income will hypothetically require an invested capital of:\n\n$1,200,000 in treasuries at 5%\n$1,000,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds at 6%\n$800,000 in high-yield corporate bonds at 7.5%\n$600,000 in S&P 500 appreciation at 10%\n$48,000 in biotech YOLOs at 125%\n$20,000 in forex YOLOs with 500:1 leverage at 300%\n$1.83 in a HYIP with guaranteed 9000% return in 24h\n\nFrom here, things get a little more complicated. Inflation might be eating at your invested capital if you consume the entire annual return rather than reinvest some of it, so you might want to realize a bit more gains than you need to support your lifestyle. But how much more? That would depend on your inflation expectations, the volatility expectations of your portfolio, taxation, etc.\nYour costs and required annual income will also vary depending on where you live, your family composition, and your lifestyle choices. Many costs which often form a part of a compensation package for an employee (such as healthcare) will be payable by you directly.\nFinally, even a fairly diversified portfolio is subject to a range of risks, from market risk to a prolonged depression - your portfolio can simply fail to perform to historic expectations within the finite time-frame of your life on earth.\nThus, while realizing the equivalent of a median U.S. household income from investments is [definitely feasible](  the wisdom of relying on this as your only source of income during your productive years is dubious.

Since you're asking the question for many of us non-mathematicians ie non professionals numbers are just a game, therefore if you find it brings you comfort to pay off the house then do it.

I know there's a lot of talk about what to do to prepare for retirement in terms of investing in a 401k and what to do and not to do before retirement, but what about once you retire? I don't see much talk about that.\nSo once you do reach that golden age to retire and have a shit load of money in your 401k account, how do things work from there. Is there some automatic withdraw system where each month you withdraw x amount from your 401k account to live off of? Do you keep withdrawing until you die like Social Security or is there some limit as to how long you keep withdrawing? Do you have any control over any of this stuff like how much you can withdraw each month and for how long?\nAny information, advice, and/or suggestions are greatly appreciated.",
        "prediction": "With a \"traditional\" 401k (and IRAs) you start taking beenfits at age 59 and a half. There's a taxable portion and if you're withdrawing from a Roth part you'll be getting that tax free. Presumably by then you'll have a better amount than the maximum 18,000 annual contribution so you'd be making some healthy withdrawals.\nWhen you have a 401k account and leave that person's employ, the plans have rules that you, as owner and beneficiary, are supposed to follow in order to keep the full benefits without unnecessary tax. You could roll over your 401k into a traditional account with no penalties (larger limit if you have it with your current company) or into a Roth account, though I don't remember if you can rollover to Roth from a traditional account-plan.",
        "answer_1": "It works like any other investment account where you can sell the investments and withdraw the money into your bank account at any time (just pay income taxes on any traditional 401k assets withdrawn).\nHow long / how much you withdrew is totally dependent on the balance of your 401k. If you have only saved $100 in there then you can only withdraw $100. Or you can probably set up automatic withdrawals, or whatever else you want.\nThere are required minimum distributions with traditional 401ks, which requires once you are 70.5 years old you must withdraw a certain percentage of the balance in a given year, that percentage increasing every year. But you can always withdraw more than that amount, assuming you have the funds to do so.\nI think the 4% safe withdrawal rate is a pretty good strategy, where if you were invested 50% stocks 50% bonds you could theoretically withdraw 4% of the account balance every year (adjusting for inflation each year) for at least 30 years without running out of money.",
        "answer_2": "The rules for what you can do with a 401k in retirement depend on your company's plan.  Some will let you set up periodic withdrawals, some let you take out money at any random time and amount you want.  Others only let you take a single post-retirement withdrawal, of the entire balance (In which case, you should roll it into an IRA).  They can have fees for setting up periodic plans, or not, or have fees for every single withdrawal.  \nRolling into an IRA is common, because then you can shop around for one you like, rather than having to go with the rules your former employer set."

        "answer_1": "Your question is the root of a concept known as the safe withdrawal rate (SWR). This is the rate at which you can draw from the interest on your assets without decreasing the principle. For many, a SWR is 4%, with a more conservative estimate being around 3%. As such, assets of $1.25M would support a 4% withdrawal rate of $50k for the first year, increasing with inflation. That last bit is important. There is an assumption that your assets will grow by at least 4% after inflation, meaning you can take out more than $50k after the first year, and so on, to keep up with inflation and keep your real spending power constant.\nThe last bit I wanted to say is about \"in the bank.\" These assets would need to be invested in a combination of stocks/bonds in order for the interest to be enough to support this kind of income. If you put it in a bank at 0.05% interest you will rapidly draw down the principle and go broke.",

Then when the investor wants to return to his home country, they simply exchange their pesos back into their home currency at the same currency rate.

I quit my job 3 weeks ago (right after Labor Day) after being with the company for 6 years, and my employer was pretty upset about it. Like wouldn't even look me in the eye as I made rounds telling everyone goodbye. The following week, I received a pay stub with the entire amount in the Insurance Deduction line and $0.00 in the Net Pay line. When I called and talked to the secretary she said the entire amount went towards insurance, and that the company paid for 2 weeks, I paid for my full 4 weeks, plus the 2 weeks the company was supposed to pay (the company and the employee each pay 50%). I was never asked if this was ok, and I never gave them permission to do it. Can they legally do this? It is my money, and I'd rather have it and go without insurance for a month until it kicks in at my new job. Any advice is welcome, I've never had the need for a lawyer before and I'm not sure how this works. I am in Iowa.\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice. I contacted my state's Workforce Development, who put me in contact with my state's Labor Division. They looked into it, and my company pays group insurance at the beginning of the month, then withholds a weekly amount from employees to make up the difference. It's shitty on the company's part that they didn't explain it, but it seems what they did is completely legal. If I've learned anything from this experience, it's that if I quit another job with group insurance I'll do it at the end of the month so I can get my full paycheck.

But you'll still get a tax free conversion to a Roth when you convert it.",
        "answer_1": "This isn't a big deal, and is easily correctable. \nYou will just need to request a recharacterizion of your 2013 contribution if you determine your AGI is over the roth contribution limit. In this way your IRA provider will distribute the contribution and the net earnings attributable to the contribution from the roth account and put them in a traditional IRA so that you can treat the previously made contribution as a traditional IRA contribution. you just want to make sure you complete this process before your tax filing deadline, and realize that you will owe taxes on any income attributable to your roth contribution between when you made the contribution and and when the recharacterization is processed.\nAs for your questions on AGI, mortgage interest and property tax deductions would not reduce your AGI. AGI is only reduced by above the line deductions which includes things like: self employment expenses, HSA or deductible retirement account contributions, moving expense, alimony, or student loan interest.\nCongrats on the bonus! This is a good problem to have.",

But I just took on a new job where I get 50% match and there are ~2 months left in the calendar year.\nDoes it make sense to withdraw all my existing 2017 401k contributions so that I can refill it with funds from my new job and my new employer's 50% match?\nNot sure if my understanding of taxes is correct, but I'd have to pay the following (to gain $9k match):\n- 10% early withdrawal fee on $18k\n- Fed and State taxes on $18k\n= approx $1800 + $7500 = $9300\nBut I'd have to pay the Fed and State taxes on another $18k anyway if I didn't do this.  So that shouldn't really count as money I'm losing?  The actual loss is the $1800 from 10%, which makes the total gain more like $7200?",
        "prediction": "I'm not an expert, but that sounds like a very bad idea. \nYou're losing money on every withdrawal, and you're only making 50% of what you could make. Are you sure your company doesn't just match, up to 5% of salary for example? Then you can just have more withdrawn from your paycheck to max out and get the full match.",
        "answer_1": "tl;dr: You're not the first, nor last, person whom has switched companies mid-year and gone from a so-so 401k to a much better/awesome 401k. The IRS has legal mechanisms to move your money around without incurring 10% early withdrawel fees or whatever.\nThe other posters are correct in a very narrow interpretation of where you're going at with your question.  Your question is this: I maxed out my 401k contribution limit with an old employer. My new employer has a better 401k matching policy. What can I do?\nFirst off, you should until the April 2018 filing deadline to rectify this situation. It happens all the time where you switch employers and sometimes numbers get messed up and you over contribute to both.\nSecond, the 401k administrators, as part of being 401k administrators, have the ability to refund your contributions for the exact reason you specified.\nThird, the specific mechanism you mentioned in your post --- that's where the posters are going after as being underhanded and illegal. Yes, that will raise flags with the IRS.\nWhat you should do now: Max out your 401k in 2017, as much as you can, for the remainder and then contact your old 401k administrator for processing refunds. I might wait until 2018 starts since at that point, 2017 earnings will largely be set in stone.",
        "answer_2": "You likely won't be able to get ahead this way.\nIf you contribute to the new employer's plan, the government will require you to withdraw all the money and any gains on that money by tax time.\nThat money will be taxed twice as income, so you can expect really low rewards on that front.\nAdditionally, if you take money out for this reason, the employer will almost definitely take back any amount they matched to your account.  Your amount needs to be in for the match to be in.  Your amount won't be in, therefore...\nI think there is nothing for you to gain by trying to cheat the rules this way."

        "question": "[UPDATE] Negotiated salary on entry-level job/lab position; offer rescinded. :-( I can't believe this happened. The boss himself said there is a \"small room for negotiation\" when he extended the offer.\nThe offer originally was for $28k for bachelor's with zero experience in an academic lab. I had a bachelor's and have 2 years part time unpaid relevant experience and 2 full time, paid summer internships with relevant lab experience.\nI looked up various threads / websites on how to negotiate. I went on Glassdoor and Payscale and looked up averages for that particular position for the company. The average was about $31k-33k. People said to add 10% - 15% to the amount and attempt to negotiate with HR.\nSo I called HR and asked for $35k; expressed enthusiasm for working in the company, etc. They came back and said the boss would paid maximum of only $29k and if I wouldn't drop my \"requirement\", they'd consider other candidates.\nWithout hesitating, I quickly told them I'd be happy to take the $29k and I'd love to work for the company as it was a very good environment. I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way and I thought they were open to negotiation (which I originally asked the HR too before naming a number).\n5 hours later, received a call from HR letting me know that the boss has gone with another candidate and my offer has been rescinded.\nI feel so sad and defeated. I've been dealing with depression for the past two years and finally feel like I am getting my act together and doing something with my life. The first offer was a god-send, even though the offer was low. I wanted to negotiate to an amount that would allow me to survive independently and afford the raising rent prices, but would have been extremely happy with a job in a good lab environment with a nice boss. I think the advice from internet sites regarding negotiating salary did not apply to entry-level lab positions in academia where I'm essentially dispensable.\nI don't know what to do at this point. I have one other interview lined up and waiting to hear back from other positions, but I feel so down. Was I wrong to negotiate? Did I come off as arrogant? Was the amount I quoted too high? What should I do in the future to ensure this does not happen again?",

In general, expressing interest and asking (nicely) for a better salary should have been fine.  Your ask seems fine.  When they come back lower than you asked, your acceptance and positive interest in working there should have also been fine.\nRescinded offers are unusual.  Either they are a terrible company to work with, or your description of your tactics bothered them (this will be someone never happy) or maybe they just found some sucker to work there for $25k.

Not only that, but asking for more than the average salary when you're fresh and not even skilled enough to be asking for average (let alone +10%), it can reflect poorly upon you. I always suggest negotiating if you think an offer is raw, but be prepared to lose it, and always be realistic. 35k on a 28k offer probably wasn't the best advice."

B) you want to increase your credit limit faster. Using it a lot and then paying it off fast will show your reliable and you could need a higher credit limit. Why do you want a higher credit limit?

We get along great but the relationship just feels different once you have lived on your own and trying to figure that out can be challenging. It also can definitely have a negative effect on your social life as a student--this isn't financial but I think it's worth considering nonetheless.

College is a better time to do that than when you're in your first job working long hours and stressed.

        "question": "Why do investors sell properties? In the beginning stages of learning about REI, hoping to purchase my first property within the next year. But one thing that's bugging me that I can't shake, is wondering why investors sell properties.\nMy thinking is that if it was a good enough investment deal, the original owner would keep it for the cash flow. So something has to be amiss, be it impending repairs or maybe projected property value loss etc.\nAny advice/insight?",
        "prediction": "Depending on the investor in question, it could be a few different reasons. I agree, though, that when you\u2019re just starting out, it can look like it\u2019s the smell test. \nMoonlighting816 got into two big reasons why investors are in REI: buy and hold & fix/reposition and sell. There are other strategies too such as the BRRRR method (Buy, Refinance, Reinvest, Rent, Repeat), but those are two been most applicable to me. \nIn the fix/reposition and sell strategy, the sell can happen anywhere from 1-2 years after they bought the property. Depending on the investor\u2019s goals, they may classify success as making $25k off of every project in this period. That is completely arbitrary, though and can vary a ton, which is where a lot of people get hung up. \nThe buy and hold strategy looks for stagnant, sometimes-losing assets that have many non-commercial capitalization events (water heater replacements, leaky roofs, etc.) and many forced appreciation levers to make cash flow greater so that the market could then look at an asset as attractive. Again, to hit cash flow off the asset earns a certain he/dollars and maybe cash flow prospects of even 25k/yr, especially in markets with fewer people or in areas where that would be attractive. \nOkay, back to you: if you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are your goals for REI? Strategy goals, time horizon, revenue goal/year... those sorts of things. \nEnjoy, looking forward to these tangible steps. ",
        "answer_1": "Investing in teal estate is not much different than investing in the stock market. \nWhen thinking about stocks consider that companies can underperform and even go out of business. No stock is risk free. You may buy a stock that has great long term potential as a buy and hold. You may buy other stocks that are in emerging markets and have higher risk.\nThe same connections can be made with real estate. Some properties are great for buy and hold. You may want to keep them indefinitely. They have low risk and a high upside.\nOther properties may he in fluctuating markets. The risk may be higher. You may have stagnant populations and job markets.\nThe other reason is to free up capital and lock in returns. You do not have a real return on investment until you have sold that investment. At the sell the return becomes real and the cash can be invested again.\nYou really do not want to own paid off properties. Part of the leverage on returns is having a payment being made by a tenant. If a tenant is essentially paying your loan payment then you are maximizing the leverage. \nFor example\nYou buy a $100k property for $20k down. Your tenant is paying the loan on the borrowed $80k and you are still getting a profitable return. When that loan is payed off then you are making a return on what may be a $200k property and $200k of your cash instead of $20k of your cash. That is not a great investment especially if the lease payment has not gone up by over 1000% in that time frame.\nWhat you can do is sell the property for $200k and reinvest that $200k return into five more properties worth $200k each with a $40k down payment. You now have $1 mill in properties purchased with $200k and lease payments that are paying down the loans. \nYour tenants can now pay down the loans on those properties until you sell and take real returns. Those real returns can once again be reinvested. ",
        "answer_2": "I work in Commercial Real Estate so I can give you a ton of reasons, but a few major ones:\nEveryone has a different expectation of the return they might make on a property. Just using a random round number, 10% might sound really good to you, but bad for another person. So a lot has to do with expectations of return.\nAlso, maybe this investor needs to sell to pay off another asset, or obligation. You never know at first, which is why the story behind the asset is so important.\nFinally, sometimes sellers aren't sophisticated. Maybe they're not managing the property well because they don't know the market well, what rents are, etc. Or maybe there's a good reason to fix up the asset but they just can't see it. These are just a handful of reasons."

        "question": "Take out equity to buy a rental property? First time posting here let me know if this doesn't belong here.\nI (30M) am married and have had our house for coming up on 5 years. We have approximately 130k in equity in our home and have around 88k left to pay off.\nWe live in a growing City and are thinking about buying another house to rent out for some passive income.\nMy understanding is that if we bought a house with a mortgage it would have a higher interest rate for it being for a rental instead of a primary residence. My thought is to refinance my current home mortgage to get the money then buy the rental outright. Thus keeping my interest rate low and bringing in maybe an extra 10k a year in rent. \nIs this the right idea? Are there any pitfalls I should know about? Should I focus on paying off my current house which could take maybe 5 to 7 years.",
        "prediction": "I would wait a while longer. Where would someone be able to buy a house for 10K a year rental income?\nI know rates kinda suck, but they are actually beginning to go lower.\nIt's never ever convenient to just write off any misses of payment, and then have foreclosed or lost property and ruined credit. Waiting, saving, and building that wealth, does take time. 10K for a rental, isn't going to have any kind of profitability for many years. And certainly not enough for taxes.\nMost importantly though is, look around, and see what you have to deal with if your house is going to be targeted. It will be. You'll need maintenance on older properties. You'll possibly need permits or contractors, in trying to fix up an older home for a rental. And also, especially in older neighborhoods, people are in their houses for long terms, and know who \"moved in\" if unfamiliar. Don't be the iffy neighbor who has tenants. Sometimes, a home is a shell....and it is up to you to ensure someone is worthy of that key, not the house. ",
        "answer_1": "One of the perks of REI is utilizing other people\u2019s money (OPM) to leverage your investment. By owning a rental right out you negate this advantage entirely on that property. You also will have less cash available to renovate the house or keep in reserve because it\u2019s all tied up.\nThat being said owning a rental outright is fantastic for your cashflow because you have no debt service. But it comes at a cost of putting all your money in one basket. If you were going to do buy and hold with cash you might as well just invest in REITs or eREITs.Much better liquidity and no dealing with maintenance or tenants. \nUnless you\u2019re competing with multiple offers and want to be the most attractive one I personally wouldn\u2019t ever go 100% cash.",
        "answer_2": "The first thing I would look at is landlord tenant laws in your city.  If you live in a landlord friendly area it's a much less risky proposition than somewhere like New York for example which is extremely tenant friendly.  I would check out the eviction process, if it's lengthy and complicated I would be very careful.\nI also wouldn't go into it thinking that you are making \"passive income\" owning a rental property because there is a lot that goes into it.  You mentioned getting a management company, which is an option, but makes the margins slimmer.\nReal estate investing can make you a ton of money, but it also comes with significant risks, which you need to be fully aware of before pulling the trigger."

That gives you much more stable returns.",
        "answer_2": "In very short, the leverage amplifies the losses too, not just the gains. Since these structured funds have to renew their future contracts all the time (most daily, monthly is the rare max), they realize losses frequently. It's not just a big drawdown that makes these funds lose, but volatility can eat the capital pretty fast.\nAll that said, a leveraged ETF will work well for you if the asset it tracks moves in the desired direction with low volatility during the time interval in question. The longer this interval, the more likely one of the two conditions won't be met (direction and low volatility).\nSee also [Investopedia]( "

        "question": "How bad do I look on paper? I recently pulled my credit score on creditkarma.com, and it came up at 678.  I am in my mid-twenties, and I have $24500 in debt: $8500 on a credit card (I've been a young idiot, I know), and $16000 in student loans (and I have already gone through a consolidation).  I have recently committed to paying $300 (just less than double the minimum payment) towards my credit card every month (and I no longer use it at all), and I pay $200 towards my student loans every month (which currently sits at a $0 balance, with no payment \"due\" until 2019 because I am so far paid ahead).  I am very committed to paying down all my debt over the next several years, and I am in a good position (with no account for additional income: raises, bonuses, etc.) to do so.\nBased on creditkarma, my credit utilization is at \"D\" (the limit is $9000, and until recently I relied heavily upon the card as a \"back-up\", which I now realize will kill me in the long term if I can't pay off the balance in full each month, and I am determined to get rid of it), my payment history is \"A\" (I have never missed a payment on any debt), my age of credit history is \"F\" (only 1 year and 9 months, although I have had my credit card since 2009?), total accounts is \"B\" (19 total, 15 closed, 4 open - 1 credit card, 3 student loans), credit inquiries \"B\" (1 hard inquiry), and derogatory remarks \"A\" (none).

She handed my coworker a copy of The Business of the 21st Century by Robert Kiyosaki to read, and they scheduled a coffee date. They met up again last night and my coworker had more questions like 'how do you make money', 'do you actually have the money you've made in your bank account', and flat out 'is this a pyramid scheme'. The woman said that she has the money in her bank account and it's not a pyramid scheme. The woman then told her what they did (or at used it as an analogy, she wasn't clear so my coworker was confused). Apparently Amazon goes to schools and tells them that if they get their students to order off of Amazon, Amazon will kick back 8% of the revenue to schools (which sounds like regular sales tactics but whatever). This woman's company tries to prevent that, and somehow they make a ton of money from it? The company's name is Bounce (not sure on spelling).\nThe way my coworker got approached makes it sound like a MLM scheme, but since they don't sell any products it sounds like a Ponzi scheme.

I have a question about early retirement, and determining when I'm \"ready.\"\nI'm currently 34, have always lived well under my means, and end up stashing most of my earnings away.  My desire is to work another 2 years or so, and then \"retire.\"  I'm just nervous about how much is enough?\nStats:\nApprox 1M in assets, 0 debt.  Break down is:\n~300K 401k\n~250K robo investment account (Betterment/Wealthfront type)\n~250K in current company stocks (would need to be diversified at some point in the future)\n~150K cash (Savings)\n~50K misc mix of random stocks, or other investments.\n5.5k Roth IRA (heh)\nNo house, No cars. Single/No husband/wife/kids.\nThe plan:\nI'd like to to continue working my job for another ~2 years, giving me time to add ~100-150k to savings (likely into the Betterment/WF like account).\nAt that point I'd move to a low cost of living country, and have budgeted to spend $2,500 USD/mo for living expenses.  Likely I would find a part time fully remote job (in the tech space) to make some money, but salary would take a back seat to both limited hours and only doing work I enjoy.  Almost certainly I would still be able earn enough to cover my monthly budge, but would rather not depend on it, and thus trying to keep it out of my calculations.\nMy question:\nWhen do you know you have enough savings to make the jump?  The 401K I believe I cannot touch until a proper retirement age. \nHow reasonable/crazy is this idea? Many thanks!",

I'll give you 3 numbers:\nConservative: 2 million. If long lives=bitter lives doesn't fit your lifestyle this would allow you to never be in huge debt and always have a backup plan/a lot of options.\nModerate: 1.2 million. Assuming you're spending the the 30K in the savings account every year this would last you until 70 unless you end up needing lots of high health care costs. \nAggressive: I know people who have more than $1 million in retirement and I'm 90% sure never work again or at least until they're 50/60.

TL;DR: I own 50% of car with Dad, with 4 years of payments left. He has no other touchable assets. I cover all payments. Dad's recently in nursing home, only makes money from social security, and has a ton of unpaid debt that he can't afford to pay from being careless with personal loans. I may end up becoming his power of attorney. What kind of liability do I have? Is there any risk of losing the car, or any risk any of this may affect my credit? \nlong version: My dad has a lot of various debts from being extremely careless with taking out loans. Now he's in a nursing home, and those debts may end up going to collections as he can no longer pay. He's lucky enough that one collections agency sent a letter stating some debt had been discharged (which honestly seemed random and out of place, that particular one was only 4 years old) but I'm sure he has plenty more debts ready to pop up. \nI did research and found that they can't touch his home/land, and he doesn't have any real assets. The only thing is the car. We both own 50% of the car, and it still has 4 years left to be paid off. Car payments aren't an issue, I've been paying and never have missed a payment. It's really my car, he just co-signed the loan for me. \nFrom what I read it seems like they could technically take his half of it and buy out my half or something to that extent? Assuming of course they go as far as to take him to court and win. I'm not entirely sure how it works....\nHis only income is social security/disability, and has been for years.\nAlso, with me possibly becoming power of attorney, what kind of debt liability does that give me? I may just end up being healthcare surrogate, but he'll probably end up needing me to be full PoA to manage his money at some point. \nHis credit at this point doesn't really matter, we're just focused on his health.

        "prediction": "If title is transferred via judicial tax foreclosure, generally the only risk you'll have is if you relied upon the description of the property in the order. As opposed to having the physical property inspected. I have seen plenty of times where the description is wrong or even switched. Texas has a database of these orders going back in to the early 2000s and if the description is either wrong or fraudulently amended it can be tricky. You're in Ohio though and I have no experience there. \nI'm mainly answering this because of how fractured the conversations about real estate investing are. There are so many people in the conversation but it seems very few of them have been in the business longer than a decade. Where whenever someone comes to us with a question they are always greeted with the same advice \"Get a fucking attorney to help you\" . Candidly, that is the best advice. \nThese conversations and guides tend to be this great amalgamation of bs advice from people have watched too many Dave Ramsey videos or have a Stanford MBA, convoluted with indexable words designed for snakeoil selling. \"Step one-locate mortgage documents for property in county capitalization.\"  You'll get gumbo like that m\u1ed9t ng\u00e0n (One thousand times) over if it is as niche as foreclosures are. Getting an attorney to work a deal for you can be costly, but those cost will be much less than he will trying to fix mistakes. \nPrior even to a title company getting involved there are plenty of pitfalls that you need a competent closing attorney to avoid. I should point out that you should take care that whoever the attorney if licensed to close in the county which the property is located, attorneys are licensed per state. If you want to stretch your imagination, I'll bet college stamps these in the back of cars. (I was stuck behind a car with a collegiate on the far right section and the front bumper started peeling off, the alert popped in my mind, that does not belong there)\nLien Positioning is a time where Arnold Palmer's words come into play. The biggest ant won't long go in the plane doesn't fit, you do have some risk based on priority of the lien and what their motivation is. They will get more aggressive as their priority rank gets lower. You might consider talking with the the attorney at the title company prior to any of this prior to going to contract and closing. They have intern which are looking to impress their intended so they will gladly research and probably do most if it for you. \nPutting a property under contract (I'm never a fan of calling these things anything other than your standard purchase agreement signed by seller and buyer) will cost some money. I wouldn't visit the county clerk a few times and read the instructions, look up in the adjoining county. If I'm aware of how much bail is, I'll pay it that day and then post bond, having gotten my property for a shaggy price (hj)\nAnd don't low-ball to intimidate everyone to get best price.

I then do my due diligence on  the properties which includes CMA and searching my county clerk's website for any outstanding liens. \nThere are plenty of risks. When you buy at auction you have to pay cash (cashier's check on the spot). You are buying a property sight unseen without any sort of seller's disclosure. The home could be (and usually is) occupied. Once you have purchased the home you need to find a way to enter the home if vacant or get the occupants out if occupied (cash for keys or eviction). Sometimes the information that you have on the house is incorrect  (eg- the home only has 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom when you thought it was a 3/2).\nThere are many risks purchasing at auction so you need to make sure that you buy the home at a sufficient discount in order to not get burned when the unexpected arises.\nBuying foreclosed homes that are bank owned is much easier. You can often use financing and you get to actually go inside the property during the showing. There is still no sellers disclosure when purchasing REO properties.",
        "answer_2": "Lots of good info in this thread. But for other novice would-be buyers I want to make a couple points. \nFirst, there are 3 types of value. Auction or liquidation value (lowest), market value (what we think of typical real estate transactions), and insurance value (highest value). \nLenders (GSE anyway, hard money lenders may be an exception but rates are steep) have minimum property requirements and standards and will not loan on houses that do not meet these. Many REO and auction properties either do not meet these or they are a risk for GSE lenders because they have not been inspected or appraised. They sell cheap because the only buyers are those with plenty of cash (although as has been mentioned, there are often cash buyers competing for these). \nIf someone needs a loan, they will be buying at market value, not auction or liquidation value. It is possible to buy a fixer upper at the low end of the market, such as if you do a 203K rehab loan, and put in some improvements and sweat equity to add value. But in general, the big discounts are going to cash buyers and they get a discount because of the risk and unknowns, and also because the only market is other cash buyers. \nBuying auction/liquidation is a very specialized and risky thing and no first time home buyer should even attempt this.

        "prediction": "I'd personally recommend you buy a house that's likely to be an investment property in the future, but do go the mortgage route regardless - just be sure not to rely on the rental income for your primary payment. Use whatever reserve fund you'll need to be comfortable living in a house to keep yourself afloat if the house doesn't rent as easily as you hope. Depending on where you decide to live, you could actually purchase a home that will classify as a rental after just a short while of living in it and then have a completely separate path to rental income that is more tried and true and less likely to be convoluted and speculative like self-storage.\nExtra: I know you're younger than most, but I'd still urge you to work with an agent for assistance in locating and closing on your home, whatever you end up purchasing. A good agent can be extremely helpful. Getting an agent's services will be free to you as long as they're representing the buyer and earns their commission through the seller's agent. Check to see if a close friend of your family or someone you know just strongly dislikes their job and would hook you up with a nice discount.

First if you've managed to not lose your ass in eCommerce, try to scale it up if you made 20k I have no doubt that you posess the potential to make 10x that. Having money when getting into this is very helpful. Im in a rather similar situation to you, im 17 with some money saved up from work and by 18 it will be between 25,000-30,000. The approach I am taking is to house hack to cut my cost of living and get deal number 1 under my belt and get a better feel for the business. in my market I can get in a small multifamily for under 10,000 on an FHA. leaving 15k to work with. Keep 10 as an emergency fund and keep saving up until I can buy another property. The goal for me is to become a full time value add investor I dont know what strategies your interested in or where exactly you want to go but you can formulate a gameplan for yourself to get you where you want to be. But once I have a few rentals and a bit of cashflow then I'll jump into flipping. If your familiar with Ben Mallah, pretty much I want to do the type of deals he does in the future. Not with hard money though. Its too risky for me personally. I think baby steps are the way to go, we gotta walk before we can run. Read a ton go to investor meetings listen to podcasts all that good stuff. I'd talk to a lender and figure out what you need to qualify for an owner occupied loan youll need an income and tax returns getting a co signer will help but the bank needs to know you can keep the payments up. You can start with under 20k of course this is market dependent but for this particular strategy its more than enough. Wholesaling is another route i'm exploring but there is a lot of gurus and BS artists in that game so caution is key. If youve managed to survive the scammers and scumbags like becker, lok, and those types I have no doubt you can make it happen. Best of luck bro!"

        "question": "[DEBT] Settlement offer on defaulted student loan...not sure what the best choice is. I have one student loan that went into default when I was unemployed several years ago. The rest of my disbursements are in good standing as they allowed me a forbearance during that time, but Sallie Mae was an asshole so here I am.\nI got a letter from the most recent collector my account was assigned to, and they are offering me a settlement. It's less than I originally borrowed and I can easily pay it right now. However, I don't care even a tiny bit about what is moral or right, I just want the most positive result for my credit score.\nSo, here's my dilemma. I know from annualcreditreport.com that this loan will cease to show up on my credit report in a year and a half. As far as I understand it, that means no one will see that the charge off/default ever happened. That's fantastic because I have had tremendous trouble getting a car loan because of this defaulted debt.\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years. I'm aware of pay for delete agreements and such, but the settlement offer doesn't contain any such offer and I don't know if I want to mess with that and just trust that they'll follow through. So, my first big question is does anyone know if this will actually help my credit, or if I would have better results by just waiting a year and a half for it to fall off and never touch it again? \nMy other concern if I do decide to take the settlement is that, since this is through a private collection agency, somehow the info will never properly get communicated back to Sallie Mae (well, Navient now). I assume as long as I keep the offer, a copy of the check I pay it with, and other documentation I can quickly shut down any future agency that tries to collect on it as well, but I'd rather not have to deal with that hassle forever. Is there any other good way to make sure this really ends forever with my payment?",
        "prediction": "What I would do is make sure you get some kind of contract that spells out exactly what you are paying, the payment date and that as long as you keep up with that, you won't have any future action against you.  Get the name and number of the collection agent and keep everything for your records.  That sound fair?",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the industry, and while I am not an expert by any means, I think I can help point you in the right direction (take it all with a grain of salt though).\nIf this is a federal loan, then you cannot discharge via bankruptcy, and they don't even need to sue you to start garnishment (kind of like the IRS).  There is also no SOL, and you should try to take care of this as soon as possible.\nGetting passed around to different collection agencies is not good, and a typical indicator of more drastic measures being taken in the near future.  You should also ask them to verify the debt to ensure you are paying the right loan with the right agency.\nThe default status is what is killing your credit report, and it will not go away until 7 years after the account is \"closed\" either via charge off or settlement.  They do seem to be willing to be reasonable, so I am sure you can get them to agree to report this as settled on your credit, which should help you out (especially if this is your only bad account).  I have seen people bounce back from chapter 7 bankruptcy in just over a year, so you should be able to do the same if you are careful.\nYou should not have a problem with them reporting the settlement to the loan servicer.  They will not get paid until the loan servicer pays them, so they are highly motivated to report correctly.  You can always ask them to put into writing anything you are not certain of, please do not just trust them to do something without talking to them about it.  This is more for documentation purposes, in case you have any additional issues come up with the account (especially with the credit agencies or a new lender).  Also request a final letter once the settlement has been paid.  They probably already do this, but it should be mentioned just in case.",

My dad is on disability and has student loans that should be taken off his credit at the end of the month. As of now, their debt to income ratio is too high apparently but even with the student loans off their credit, banks still believe it\u2019s too risky to loan them the money to finish the house because they already started it.

It's frustrating because my income is already taxed 40% and being able to max out my 401k and my HSA is one of the only ways I'm able to reduce my taxable income. I don't really understand why these limits exist when people with higher income also get taxed at higher rates already...\nFurthermore, when we take money out of our 401ks it still gets taxed anyway. :\\\nRant aside - what do you guys do to compensate for this? And who do I have to write a strongly worded letter to help get this repealed? ",

It makes sense to defer money more to highly compensated employees to attract and retain them.\nPer IRS: \"in 2017, you\u2019re a highly compensated employee if you own more than 5 percent in the business that sponsors the plan or if you earn more than $120,000. A high-paid employee is counted as highly compensated if he or she earned more than $80,000 in the current year or the previous year.\" Laws change so you need to verify my info.\nIt's more complicated than that complicating it further.

        "question": "HIRING MANAGERS: Are company 401k policies usually negotiable? I move employers a lot. I tend to get bored after a couple of years and look for a new challenge. This has served me well as I usually get a nice little raise every time I move. Every company I've gone with has had a policy that 401k can't be contributed to until you're there for 6 months. At that rate I'm unable to contribute almost 1/4 of the time. I plan to retire early so and recently realized this is hurting me.. a lot.\nI always negotiate salary and it usually works out. I've never tried to negotiate 401k policies though and I think it may be something I should try. Would a company ever remove that 6 month restriction during negotiations? At least meet half way and allow immediate contributions but no matching until 6 months?\nI'd love to hear from someone in an HR/Finance department to clarify if things like this are usually negotiable within an org.",
        "prediction": "As an HR professional, I can tell you that it's up to the company to decide where their hiring policy horizons start/stop. No one is going to ever care enough to negotiate off of their standard practices (e.g. 6 or 0 month wait) but they would be willing to tell you that, in general and indexable responses don't tend to vary at all per-hire.\nThe standard wait for many non-unionized American manufacturers for FT benefits like 401k, healthcare, and tuition reimbursement is 6-mo as well. No one is going to negotiate SRP matching - either they'll match you or they won't - those benefits are all established separately per-bench trying to drive operations efficiencies without sacrificing quality.\nThe reason you see this especially in operational environments is because of ADA accommodations and staffing standards. No one wants a janitor to have access to 401k matching and if there isn't a wait, many people who are hired in as clean-up, entry-level labor will try to quit on day 1, max out their match in 2 or 3 weeks and go to idle on day 16 without a full week of work - unable to be dismissed anyhow. The ADA then states that you cannot dismiss that person until they are MDBQ - these businesses would go under in a month if everyone who looked at them wanted vacation long enough to max out FF.\nThe provision to match is risk based. They have established where the cost-benefit is in relationship to the expected performing population and specific job hazards/standards. For instance, the the 6 month wait for a janitor is >>6mo at my operation for an IT Systems Architect intern which is FT remote. Using intended productive risk for engagement to forge a better day.\nBenefits and wages are all cost based. 401k matches are a reflection of productive work hours and the skilled per-week staffing determination of benchmarks. Put another way, the risk cost is that there is going to be a person who works 40 hours in any given week, because they worked 40 hours in the week before too, just as they will next week and so long as that person maintains a SofT to their Supervisor (ease control).\nEvery business person to person is business exp. BAD benes and wages count as then normalized STAFFING determining factors. No self-respecting, self-funding biz is going to want to pay more for something just because you asked for it. Ever saw headers and trails? superconducting wire under cryo in a micronic container that weighs as much as a horse? That 2g wire with 25 ft of trail on cold is 140K a mile on the low end. It's not going to change even though I ask them to drop their risk by maintaining normal operational temps and not carrying so many miles of trail.\n(Hope this makes sense and helps you see where I'm coming from.

        "answer_1": "No. Company 401k policies are NOT NEGOTIABLE.  The company is required by law to have the same policies for all employees in the group.  Some very large employers have multiple groups, with multiple 401k plans with different rules, but these are rare exceptions and even then they are required to put employees into the appropriate plan by some definitive rules, such as subsidiary A employees into plan A and subsidiary plan B employees into plan B.\nMany legal restrictions exist to prevent employers from favoring select employees, such as highly paid workers or management.  This also means that they are legally restricted from waiving rules like waiting periods, vesting or modifying matching for select favored employees.  You will NOT be able to negotiate different 401k rules for a single employee.\nThere are no legal restrictions on vacation policy, time off, work from home rules, benefits such as health care and so on.  Some companies (usually smaller ones) do allow negotiating benefit packages and employee/employer costs for benefits.  You can also negotiate sign-on bonus and severance agreements.  But you are legally not entitled to different 401k treatment from all other employees.  Attempting to negotiate 401k rules is a waste of time.",
        "answer_2": "Not exactly what you asked but just an fyi, there are legal restrictions on matching so that part isn't something you're likely to be able to change.\nBut you can still max it for the year even if you can only contribute a few months of that year."

While I feel I can meet that requirement, that's ridiculous so I'm looking elsewhere.\nI have an Ally savings account with a bit of money in it and I was thinking of transferring it there.  A few questions:\n-How do I deposit cash?

Is there a way to avoid wasting $60?!\n-Is Ally my best choice?  I live in Michigan and don't travel out of the state too much.

The app is amazing and the person's on the other end when you call (yeah, I still write checks too) are super nice, friendly and knowledgeable.\nMethod of getting cash for many non-commercial customers is an ATM (Ally pays fees incurred at other banks, many of which have international branches with whom they'd be happy to share responsibility). \nDepositing cash - either go into BofA, ask for $1500 (or whatever he cap will be) cash, splurge for a pack of $1 bills (2 envelopes at most, maybe enlist a friend who you'd happy repay $3 or use a zero fee ATM if you're that close - $1 or $2 in convenience fees if you're a few dollars short), or, if you've got the app, snap a pic of the check (this works for tangible cash like you get from Poker too, I guess).

I was thinking getting a place around 300k or less so that I can move out in a couple years and use it as a rental property and get something else. \nAny input would be appreciated. I\u2019m a doctor so I hear I have access to PMI free loans? Are doc loans worth it? Thanks for all the input.",

I'm going to quit my job soon, and move. If I were to buy a place for $400-500k, it would actually be around the same I pay in rent now. Even after loans, rent, saving, and frequent travel, we have an extra $3000 a month in cash flow, so not too worried about home maintenance and such. \nOnly reason not to buy would be if you expect to move in the next 5-7 years, but doctors dont seem to move much and have great job security (I'm assuming your doctor based on your salary and debt load).

        "question": "Investing for minor My little sister just turned 16 years old. For context, we are 12 years apart, I'm now 28. My family immigrated to California from Vietnam from empty hands. Our dad died due to inability to qualify for any medical assistance and our lack of money for adequate treatment. So I had to work 2 full time jobs while in college full time as a 19 years old to support my depressed mom and my little sister who just started elementary school and barely knew any English. It was an uphill battle and a struggle but we've pulled through. I finished school and have a great career now that can support everybody, however I want my sis to be prepared and financially educated before she goes into the real world.\nI felt it is important to teach my little sis the power of saving and investing early in life, and I guess she's been listening. I gave her odd jobs here and there to \"pay\" her some spare changes, and she's been saving that up. On her 16 year old birthday, she came to me with $500 in hand, and told me she wanted to invest this money and get into stocks. I was so happy and so so proud of her, she is maturing so fast. And I'm ashamed to admit that I am grossly underprepared for this moment. So here are my questions:\n1) What brokerage can she open her account? I'm using Robinhood, however they don't allow minors to open an account. Brokerage that allows partial share is great too.\n2) What type of stocks should she get into? I asked her to do some homework of stocks she'd like to get, and she came back with a list of things (Disney, Nike, etc)\n3) What other type of investment that a 16 yo can get into? I'm stressing the importance of not putting your eggs in one basket and trying to expand her horizon.\nThank you for your input!",
        "prediction": "Considering the company that Apple, Google, Amazon, Home Depot, and a few thousand others have been keeping lately, I'd say your sister's input is more valuable than you think. I mean, sure she can't buy shares of her own website, but she may know a few things you'll find of value. ",

Today, my 93 year old grandmother with dementia received a call from her \u201cnephew\u201d saying he was in trouble and needed money.

        "question": "What's the consensus on the sweet spot for car age? What is the optimal age to purchase a car at, i.e., the age at which new car depreciation and the risk of serious maintenance issues is best balanced?  ",
        "prediction": "As others mentioned, it's usually around 3 years old.  Many people turn in leases after their term.  The cars are either sold via the manufacturer's big used car sales (department stores for cars), or they are available at the dealer as they try to make the most from this car by selling themselves.\nAnother alternative is to wait a few more years, around when the car is 7 or 8 years of age.  After this point the vehicles start to have less luxury features (that are often in the lease contracts), sometimes are less likely to be hoons/the type of person who is likely to jump to a new car just to have \"got it first\" -- but also age has likely begun to deteriorate them so it's going to be a bit of a crap shoot.\nThe true answer, of course, is to cross-reference with a RepairPal or similar to see if they are actually reliable past the 40-60k miles and just premium off-lease vehicles.  This is what my 2011 Sorento looks like.  I bought it when it was 5 years old and 57k miles for half what it's worth brand new :P",
        "answer_1": "The previous owner's maintenance and care habits are far more important than age or mileage.\nDepreciation will depend on the specific model and condition.\nIf you're looking for value, buy something unpopular and spare yourself the \"Honda Tax\".  ",
        "answer_2": "It really depends on the car.  My last purchase was a 7 year old Corolla with 84k highway miles from a widow with records of doing all the regular maintenance.  In the 6 years I've had it, it's hardly needed any repairs beyond regular maintenance like battery, tires, timing belt, etc.  \nI probably wouldn't buy a car that old or with that many miles if it hadn't been a commuter car, though.  And in the used car market, I feel like it's not that a X year old car is necessarily a good deal (or a car with X miles).  If you watch the market for a while, you'll learn the market price for cars at a certain age or with certain mileage, and you'll be able to spot a good deal when you see one.  A 5-year old car at one price might be a much better deal than a 3-year-old car at a higher price, if you get what I mean."

A friendly/interesting/professional mix of PF and TEDx is all i'm asking for. Or this may just be my personal view.",

Furthermore I am commanded to give to God first (hence no hesitations) - and live off the rest.  Those will probably be unpopular thoughts, but that's ok.  That's what I believe, and that's what the OP asked.\nSmall note - unless you are Jewish, you aren't \"tithing\" - tithing is more or less an Old Testament requirement.  NT requirements are a little different... we're required to give \"joyfully\" which is a bit open ended.  So to call it a tithe and just label it 10% falls a little short.  [Here is a pretty good article about that.]( \nI chose to give post tax, because I don't see any of that taxed money.  I don't really feel it'd be wrong either way though, as I'm supposed to give cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7).  I should give as much as I can, with the fact in mind that 10% is what was required when the law (OT) was not perfect.  Under NT law, we can become perfect (the sacrifice is bigger!) so 10% (I would say) is a hard minimum.\nI also give out of my total income - from all of my jobs.  I also increase my giving when I get a raise or whatever.\nNow I'm not saying any of that is easy.  Sure I could do a lot with that money.  I could probably do good and or fun stuff with the time I spend on church, too.  The cheerfulness I chose to have, is not dwelling on the fact that I could invest that money and retire 2 years sooner (or whatever) or that I could be fishing or sleeping, or not wrangling these kids, during church.  It's my choice to be ok with using my money this way....\nSorry for being so wordy.  Hope that answers your question reasonably.",

I didn't pay this the year I graduated, but I kept the amount I needed to donate, and donated that much extra the next year.\nThe percent I give away doesn't hamper my ability to save or live my modest lifestyle, but it does mean I can't pay off my loans as quickly as I'd like.

        "prediction": "All else being equal, it will almost never be cheaper to get two loans instead of one.\nWe'll assume those $600/mo payments go toward the same thing - a house.\nSo here are the options, assuming 5%:\n\n10% down, $30,000 house, $300+30K=525 payments.\n15% down, $45,000 house, $450+45K=505 payments.\n20% down, $60,000 house, $600+60K=486 payments.\n25% down, $75,000 house, $750+75K=415 payments.\n30% down, $90,000 house, $900+90K=375 payments.\n\nSo mortgage itself is cheapest in the long run with the 5% down payment. It also has the lowest payments if you have it $300/mo below your girlfriend's payments. At 20% down payment, you can buy yourself a house for $30,000.\nWith the construction loan and land loan, we'll assume you pay a little more in interest rates since they know you're going to need a mortgage later unless you paid everything up front. Presents zero problems and if you got married, there's done research showing unmarried people are also more likely to get divorced, so....probably gonna need the mortgage to make sure someone can buy the other out.\n\n5% down AND 5% more in interest, complicates it a bunch, probably results in looking at a total cost increase of 50% or more (compared to just having that money saved up from a 30 year loan if time is worth anything).",

        "question": "Relationship goals with Personal Finance in mind How can a relationship planning to last best balance between the obvious relationship expenses (wedding, honeymoon, home) and long-term goals like retirement?\nBackstory:\nI'm 29 and she just turned 30, together 3 years and planning to marry within the next 2. Currently, I make $34K (hopefully soon to be more but no promises yet) and she just got a job with our city emergency response unit that starts at about $15/hr and should also rise over time with increased union wages, raises and whatnot.\nLet's say we're starting from the beginning. $1,000 cash emergency fund that cannot/will not be touched. Average of $500 in each savings account, and another $500 in each checking account (so $2k in the bank). I have no debt at all and she has about $10k in student loans. We have already had conversations and have begun tracking our expenses, saving up as much as we can, and avoiding big, unnecessary spending. We also spoke about keeping our wedding small (like 10 people small) and keeping it as inexpensive as possible (8-10k). We're also planning on buying a home in the next 5 years if possible.\nWith her new job comes some pretty awesome benefits, including a 401a. She knows nothing about it and I know the basics, but I'm not seasoned in any way to be making those types of decisions (She also mentioned something about since she works for the city then she can possibly get student load forgiveness?). We plan on going to meet with an adviser but I wanted to ask PF to get a wide range of viewpoints on that as well.\nTL;DR How do we balance retirement savings and paying down about $10k in debt while at the same time planning on getting married and buying a home in the next 5 years?",

The lender will not look so kindly on you suddenly dropping an additional $10k on your marriage, so don't do that.  Put the rest down on her $10k student loan debt, and then just keep saving as much as possible.\nWhen you get married go to your employers and see if the payment service accepts bi-weekly payments instead of monthly payments.  If they don't offer and you have to pay out of the EF, once you pay off the student loan, just set up a bank account with the same EF amount and set the minimum at whatever it costs bi-weekly for the loans ($500 + 70% of monthly expenses should be a safe min. Using that plan I used to be able to pay off 20k faster over the course of 3 years).  Also check into listening to Dave Ramsey.

        "question": "Should I dump 2/3rds of my savings on student loans? I graduated college in 2012 with $26k in student loans. 7 years later, I still owe $14,644 with an interest rate at 4.875%.  I recently increased my monthly payment from the minimum of $120 a month to $300 a month - I'll have my loan paid off in April 2024 and my servicer will have gotten more than $1,700 in interest from me.\nTo be honest, I'm sick of looking at this debt. I have $9,100 in my savings account which gives me 1.88% APY. Doing the math, it makes more sense to dump much of my savings onto the loan as it'd save me more money that what I'm making with the savings account. \nWhat I'm thinking about doing is dumping $6,100 from my savings onto the loan, which brings the loan balance down to about $8,544. I'll have $3,000 left in my savings as an emergency fund. I'll then increase my monthly payment to $900 a month which will get my loan paid off around July 2020 (this also leaves my with just over $100 a month extra after all my expenses like food, rent, car insurance, etc). My servicer will only get about $200 in interest from me by then.\nAfter the loan is paid off, assuming I don't get a raise between now and then, I'll have my student loan completely paid off which means I'll have $1,000 extra per month toward whatever I want - but I can easily get my savings built back up to what it was after months\nI've also considered other places to put my money that would earn me more, but I haven't come across anything with low risk and would yield greater than 4.875%. \nThere's definitely an emotional element to this - letting go of $6,100 is tough.

What happened?\nI thought carefully about what Reddit said. Today I forged a path using what I determined to be the most intelligent and relevant pieces of advice in the thread. I began this morning by asking my boss for a private meeting. We met later that afternoon. In this meeting I began by telling him I was\n\nUnhappy with my compensation.\nThat because of my contributions to the company, X revenue was generated.\nThat because of 2., he could expect me to bring in Y revenue in the future.\nThat a 25% raise was eminently fair based on 2. and 3.\nAt this point, I knew that I was in for a dime, in for a dollar, so I asked for a bonus equal to 50% of my annual salary.\n\nHe told me that a 25% raise would make me the highest paid employee with my title, and that it was more in line with what managers were making.

I told him I knew the number was a bit arbitrary but I had to ask for something concrete.\nHe told me he would get back to me at the end of the day. 5:30 rolls around, and he pulls me into an office. He tells me that his boss and him carefully reviewed my request. He offers me the following:\n\n20% raise\n50% of my annual salary as a bonus\n\nI accepted, and we shook hands.

If they believe they succeed in their long term plans, then that means you will receive the full benefits of potential upside later instead of now. (The pacifiers)\n\n\nCompanies have to demonstrate they value expiring followers. They cannot just count employees then give them back a yearly percent of their missing earnings.\n\n\nUpper management has to be the one making employee's pay for the company. If employees make their own pay, if they die the upper management becomes under new management because of personal responsibility.\n\n\nThe market wage cannot include the pay that will be given by companies unless it is the company making the offer to an existing employee.\n\n\nProfit on sales per conduction is a follow through that only happens when the company feels empowerment.\n\n\nThe risk is always the employees when the market turns, the investors they are automated, but the employees is the weakness in conviction.\n\n\nThe less the quick turnover in management the denomination of equity risk middles the new market.\n\n\nCurrently the only differentiation for the average employee is productivity.

        "question": "How to calculate a pension or pension increases vs. savings for retirement TLDR: Golden Handcuffs question. How to calculate the equivalence of a pension vs retirement savings accounts. \nSo, I am one of the lucky few to have a pension. I am already vested. The way it is structured is based on years worked, age and highest average earnings over a 3 year period. Just got a promotion last year. Am in the last few stages of my pre FIRE life. I'm trying to evaluate whether to work 2 1/2 more years or 1 1/2 more years. \nI will be able to meet our expected expenses (with some room to spare) with 403b, IRAs and pension in 1 1/2 more years.  But, if I worked one more year, I would get about $8k more per year in my pension (67k vs 75k per year).   This would give us a nice cushion. \nBut, my job is quite stressful with this promotion and I don't know if it's worth it. \nOne way to calculate the worth of a pension would be to value it at the 4% withdrawal rate. So, 8k would equal $200,000 in a retirement account.  However, when my spouse and I both pass, there will be no assets left from this theoretical sum. So another way to calculate it would be to estimate my life expectancy and then a withdrawal rate that would spend down the principal in that time. I think this would be around a 8% withdrawal rate for me.  That would mean that an 8k increase = 100,000 in retirement savings. \nAny thoughts on this?  \nThe reason I am asking is that most FIRE or other retirement calculations are based on a pot of money that you withdraw from and not from a pension. \n$8k per year is a nice reliable increase, but frankly, my stress might not be worth it. This equivalency scenario seems to be one that would help me make the decision. \nThanks!",

        "answer_2": "There's a rule of thumb that every $100/month of pension is worth about $18,000 (alternatively$1000/yr = $15,000) at retirement. This means that this extra $8k of pension could be worth around $120k (similar to your math). Obviously, to get a more accurate number you have to factor in inflation, age, life expectancy, etc. That being said, a $67k pension is quite a nest egg already (worth about $1M) so the answer depends on your expenses and whether the pension is inflation-adjusted.\nTo help with your FIRE calculations, I would recommend the [\"Rich, Broke, or Dead\" Early Retirement Calculator](  treating the pension and other benefits like Social Security separate from your investments in the \"Extra Income\" tab.

My justification simply asked that they consolidate the missed payments down to the two that actually occurred.\nLast week, I received a statement from Equifax saying that the account information on my Nelnet accounts had been updated, which I thought was good news, but further inspection showed that all the late payments were still present.\nFast forward to today when I checked my credit report on CreditKarma to see that the late payments with Nelnet had ballooned from 20 to 40. Additionally, my recorded payment history went from something like 650 down to 447 payments on file. \nHow is this possible? The adviser at Nelnet suggested I consolidate, which would not take care of anything in the past, but might look good on my credit report. Essentially, those accounts would be closed down and a new one opened up. Can't this hurt me?\nI am now in a great financial position, but I'm being smothered by the mistakes of my past. I want to buy a house and start progressing a little bit, but I'm stuck. What can I do? I'm lost.\nThanks for reading. Any advice is welcome.",

        "answer_1": "Well. You don't have \"a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet\", you have 10 federal loans all serviced by Nelnet. Each loan was disbursed separately, and can have varying terms. Borrowers typically end up with 1-2 loans per year, one subsidized, one unsubsidized.\nSo yea, you actually have 10 loans, and 10 missed payments each time. If you look at the credit bureaus reports they'll show the 10 accounts too.\nThere's pretty much nothing you can do about that.",
        "answer_2": "I'm in the exact same position. Just call nelnet or w/e other lender has your loans and consolidate into 1. I've talked to them and there's no penalties (of course everyone has different terms) for consolidating into 1 account and making a single payment a month. After you make a few payments your credit will start to skyrocket. Only takes a few payments to see results. "

During these adjustments, we talk about whether things like the food budget has been working for us, or if we want to start saving money for a pet in the future.

(650 on TU right now) I have several open cards, most of them have relatively low limits, and they're all carrying a zero balance. I try not to use them unless I can pay them off the same month.\nAnyway, of all the cards, only the one issued to me by Credit One has an annual fee, which they charge to me monthly. I've been thinking about closing it, since I've got to send them $8.33 every month just to have the card.

        "question": "ELI5: The interaction between unemployment and wage stagnation. What pressures are acting to keep wages flat? In theory, it seems that low unemployment would drive up wages as companies are competing harder to find talent.\nWhat other pressures are acting on the job market to keep wage growth flat despite really low unemployment and an economy that\u2019s growing?",
        "prediction": "Three primary reasons I can think of\n1. People seeking jobs today are often younger and healthier, they're not part of the labor unions. Labor unions negotiate contracts with companies that set minimum wage standards for their members. This gives workers more bargaining power when negotiating their pay.\nLabor unions also look out for the welfare of their members. The few labor unions we have today are mostly heavily tied with the public sector and aren't as inclined to increase their minimum wage.\n2. The economy has fractured into gig work. Nowadays a person can be a \"company\" without necessarily registering as one. A freelance artist, music/gaming streamer, or a sports coach could all market themselves as companies. This creates an irregular supply of labor because it's difficult to recruit a \"temp\" to help with webflow/wordpress development work weeks from now when November rolls around. Or it's difficult to find someone able and willing to forego their spring break and instead help a startup create a sales funnel to help sell a product next summer. The easy solution for the temporary businesses is to pay the supply of labor itself. Often non-commercial non-profit skills development organizations have more leeway to pay temp work minimum wage or less because of their tax-payer funding so they are used to supply scarce skilled labor. \nGig work doesn't pay minimum wage because those doing the work earns their income through sales trying to acquire customers. Instead of paying a worker directly you pay the gig work registration company, which in turn maintains relationships with people to fulfil the outstanding work. Presents zero overhead and if the supply of labor goes done or demand falls off you can always find a replacement business partner. Also, it makes it harder to make a challenge against you or your company because your contract is with another company, not an individual worker.\n3. Globalization, companies on the far East coast have to negotiate cheaper work from the east coast. They're in direct competition with that Thai plastic cup making company. Or further still, that Thai plastic cup making company has to compete with a similar company in long bin republic of china.\nI've lived near Silicon Valley for far too long to have a decent idea what the current economic landscape is like in the rest of America.

I love my career, feel very fulfilled, and my work gives me a huge sense of purpose. \nHow does your advice change for someone who wants to extend their retirement?

If you have other goals, or worse, consumer debt, backing off on the retirement saving so you can meet that goal is fine. You say you want to buy a house. Buying a house is a good goal. You can have it paid off by the time you are retirement age, which would help a lot with monthly expenses. I would still try to get the full company match. For example, if your company matches 5%, and your putting in 10%, going down to 5% for a few years is okay. If you just stop contributing altogether, you are leaving money on the table.\nNot everyone has the same idea of what retirement is. A lot of people share this idea of never working again, and just lounging around all day, or traveling. Other people (including people like Warren Buffet, who's 87) never retire in that sense. Instead they do work that they enjoy, secure in the knowledge that they could quit at anytime and still be well off financially. That's what financial independence is. Having an income from a job is nice, but having your 401k, IRA, etc after 59.5 means you aren't dependant on that income. If your boss  is an ass towards you, you can just walk out without giving it a second thought. ",

Run a calculator and figure out what path you're on.  If it looks ok to you, looks like something can live with if you are forced to retire earlier than you expect, then go for it.\nAt the end of the day, the only one you have to answer to is yourself or, depending on situation, your family.

I want to move out of my parents house and into an apartment. I am confused as to where to start this process.

I agree with the other posters who say you aren't financially ready to move out with $15k in debt, a paycheck of $53k a year, and high expenses. First thing to do is move back to your parents' house, been there, and wait a while (at least a year) to save some money, pay down your debt, improve your savings, take a look at the job market, etc. Make sure you've got 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved up. Keep this goal in mind and work towards reaching it and in the meantime pick up a second job to help you, even if only part-time.\nThe truth is, it's often easier to have more personal independence and a better quality of life in an inexpensive house or condo with flat mates or renting a room, or if possible moving to a place where the rent is cheaper than in the house your parents are renting. This can be a better way to save money and earns Independence points, in trying to acquire property ownership points as well. In the documented stories, especially those of authors, people who've moved away from their parents to start a new life report back saying how hard it was to be a newly independent adult.

We absolutely didn't want to do that 1 because it's a bad deal 2 our schedule for multiple reasons couldn't allow it.\nI guess their agent failed to point out that the purchase contract indicated occupancy at closing and they just assumed we were following local convention?\nWhat kinds of things would you ask for to make up for this? Our realtor is getting a lawyer involved and trying to get compensation for hotel, meals, movers, a storage unit, and maybe just extra cash on top of things for our trouble.

None of these people who are freaking out have experienced this....jeez...when in Rome...\nAnyways...it was never an issue, people actually do leave....but you have a different scenario. I dont think the sellers are on the hook as much as their agent.

        "question": "Turns out my knee surgery was at an out of network hospital. We owe $20k. February 29 I had ACL surgery. I've been with this doctor for 4 years, he's operated on this knee before, but at a different hospital (Lakeside Hospital, new orleans).  So we have history, they know I'm with Aetna.  So when they told me I needed surgery again we went ahead and scheduled it, my Dr told me it would be at a different hospital, Omega Hospital. A couple days later they called me and confirmed that my insurance approved everything. \nWent for my preop appointment the week before surgery, did all the blood work and stuff and then met with the finance lady at the hospital. She ran all my information and told me we would have to pay $500 and that would be it.\nWent in for surgery, paid $500 the day of, surgery went smoothly, went for my follow up with my doctor a week and a half later, everything seemed normal. \nToday, we got the EOB for the surgery and were totally shocked to find out that this hospital was out of network, and our outstanding balance was $20,000.\nI am so overwhelmed and stressed out about this. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do. I don't have $20k laying around. I cook for a living, I don't make the big bucks.\nAm I totally screwed?\nEDIT: FINALLY the doctor called me.  The hospital will write off the $20k since we have out-of-network benefits.  This doctor does a lot of surgeries here and this happens all the time, they said.  Thanks everyone for your help and advice.  What a huge sigh of relief!",

If you got permission from your doctor and/or insurance company, go above the company that approved the procedure....probably gonna be a long and painful appeals process. \nHonestly, looking at your EOB is like looking under the hood of your car when it starts making a weird noise.

        "answer_2": "No, you're not totally screwed. Everything else that has been said applies here; plus almost all health insurance companies have 3 deductibles, in network deductible, out of network deductible and out of pocket maximum. It sounds that even if the 2nd does not apply the third will (which is typically around the 6kish limit).\nE.g. my in network is 2.5k out of network is 3k and out of pocket is 6k.\nSo i pay everything up to 3k for out of network, then I pay a copay % of 15% on everything above 3k till I have paid a total of 6k for the year and I no longer have any liability for any health care costs.\nIt sounds very much like the hospital has made a mistake; contact Aetna and the hospital."

I am the owner of a houseboat, and yesterday I had a gentleman call me from Colorado (the boat is located in Florida) and asked me about wanting to purchase my boat. At first I thought he was messing with me because who buys a boat unseen? \nHe saw my ad on craiglist and wanted to buy my boat and pay three months non liveaboard dock rent (my houseboat comes with a slip.) I agreed and I gave him the pricing six thousand for the boat (asking price, he didn't haggle me) and one thousand three hundred and seventy two dollars for three months of dock rent. \nHe agreed to the pricing and we decided PayPal was the safest bet to send the money. \nHe chose buyer and seller to send the money with me covering the fees ( I offered) and I would send him the title and proof of paying the three months rent and a bill of sale with as in no warranty on it. \nHe did send the money and its sitting in my paypal balance. \nMy question is, can this go wrong? If so, how can I protect myself from  losing my title if it does? \nI want to add that I don't think he's going to screw me over, he was very open with all of his information, very polite and I didn't get any negative vibes from him, but you can never be careful enough.

        "answer_2": "If you protect yourself, paypal is fine. But you really need to take extra steps to protect yourself.\nThat means get his name and address, validate it by getting his driver's license, include any title information, have him sign that and complete the title transfer in person, with you there. Make sure everything matches. If he refunds it via paypal you have the info to sue, if it's fake you will know that the title was marked up with fake info and can go about the process of getting it voided (though it's probably already void, if he filled it out with fake info he won't get that boat registered anywhere and won't be able to sell it) and then the boat can be reported stolen.\nAs long as the transaction is done in person, with a written signed contract, you can just sue in court to get it if a refund is attempted. I would not do it if he refuses to come out in person and sign."

Being on the lower end of the lower/middle class, they will be more likely to spend it than save it. And they'll probably spend it where they normally do- on groceries and daily needs.

No issues with debt:income ratio. I don't mind buying stuff for my kids or wife, but I feel guilty as hell buying things for myself. For example, on a whim I bought my wife and kid a Switch (Pokemon themed) on launch day for Lets Go Pikach  (they are both huge Pokemon fans, I couldn't give a poke less). $400 spend, no fuck given. But I sit here kicking my ass about spending $30 on a video game for myself, or Gods forbid, thinking about a VR setup at home that would cost about the same as the Switch did.\nLast week I got an unexpected decent check from my mortgage company due to an escrow overage. $850.

It is listed as an investment, and the listing indicates that there is another hookup for a mobile home on the back acre.\nThere were showings on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. All of which listed location, surroundings, and the trailers as reasons why they were not interested.\nEdited to add: The street is a dead in street. There is one way in and one way out. When a prospective buyer turns into the street, they see this:  \nThere is no diverting people away from seeing the shitty trailorhood.\nEdited to add:\nThe only comp on my street/in the neighborhood is this house:  \nIt sold for $162,500 last year. It also had a good bit of land with it, and the house had not been updated. However it is not a pier & beam house. But the back of the property did flood in the 2016 flood resulting in a workshop being flooded out (and they did not rebuild or renovate the workshop). My property did not flood.

I'm familiar with where you're house is and the area. \nI took a look at your listing and my original thought is you're massively overpriced. The rents in that area are low and you're in the middle of nowhere. I can't speak for all investors out here, but at that price point you can't compete with houses in BR that will attract the LSU crowd as well as families. The only people that want to live in that area are going to be people that grew up in that area. The house also needs work. The first things I would do is paint all the dark wood white, redo kitchen counters, add new appliances, and something needs to be done with that bathroom. I'd estimate 10-15K in costs. For a similar sized house in similar shape in BR I'd expect to pay 80-100K. Sure, I wouldn't have the yard you have, but I would never want that sized lot for a rental anyway. All in all, I think you're making a mistake trying to market as an investment. \nYou're also competing with so many houses that just got remodeled/flipped from the flood. I have a buddy that just bought a totally updated house that's 700 sq/ft larger than yours off of Millerville (closer to civilization) for about 20K less. \nI think you'd be better off just lowering the price and selling to someone who wants to stay in that area and is already comfortable seeing trailers here and there.\nIf I were you I'd ask my realtor to show me these comps again. I can't imagine there are comps supporting this price point.",
        "answer_2": "You have to find some comps. You're looking for overimprovements in nearby or similar hoods.

Would cost $300-$400 but you need an appraiser who likes puzzles not someone who needs a target number to hit. \nJust another option, if the place is on 2 acres can you carve off a couple homesites for trailers (especially if you have utilities already on one). If you sold 2 1/2 acre sites that would be some money in your pocket that would allow you to accept less for the house. OR add this fact (if it's legally possible) to the marketing info and maybe an investor will pick the place up and do the lot split). You say it's listed as an investment but who knows what that means, if you can split the lot make sure that is prominently mentioned in the listing. \nIf you are having showings, I'd not be inclined to drop the price too much (if anything). That means you haven't turned off buyers with the price. Someone will make you an offer, you can counter, and see where you can meet. We get spoiled by markets where things sell in days but realistically 2-3 months is a normal marketing time in many markets. You may need longer than typical marketing time and that's fine if you can hold out for your price. \nAnother thing you might consider is seeing if your agent will get other agents to come take a look and give their opinion on your price. Kinda like they do on tv shows where the realtors tour the flips and say it's overpriced lol. But you will get some opinions from people who work in the area and know the market. It's also kinda guerilla marketing because those realtors have clients who might not have seen it otherwise, it doesn't hurt to have it on more people's radar. "

        "question": "Best month to quit I always scratch my head a little bit when I hear about people quitting the rat race in December.  I would expect just working a few months into a new calendar year is optimal because you can:\n\n\nMax out another year of 401K contributions.\n\n\nMax out a deductible IRA.\n\n\nMax out the standardized deduction/ personal exemption (income taxed at 0%)\n\n\nMaybe even max out the 10% or 15% tax bracket of income if you think that's smart.\n\n\nWe are talking about at least $30k of tax-free or low-tax income potential here.  Does this make good sense or am I missing something?",
        "prediction": "Everyone's situation is different. I get what you're saying about maxing out tax-advantaged accounts and ensuring you are paying little or no tax on those last few months of income. The thing to keep in mind though is that if you've made the decision to leave the rat race, you may not been in the best situation to be concerned about all those extra taxable dollars. There are far more factors involved in the decision to quit a job than analyzing the net impact on your annual/quarterly tax bill.",

        "question": "Car loan gone south. Kiiinda freaking out Ok, so on Black Friday I went car shopping. Went to a dealership to get a car. Had pre-approval on 10000 loan. Prepared to do 1000 in down. (Car dealership had signs saying 9999 for a car. And, my old clunker bit it somewhat suddenly. So I thought,\"cheap new car.\") They only had no feature stickshifts for this price of course. \nI don't drive stick and we haggled for a pre-owned certified automatic for 16000. Not sure if I was getting taken by sales person, but the car was nice and on initial inspection I could afford the payments. So I went for it. Drove off lot after signing papers and  am super pumped about the car.\nA few weeks later I got a letter saying the financing was not approved and loan was denied due to insufficient credit info.\nSo now the loan isn't going to work, what options do I have? Do we renegotiate the loan?(will I get a worse loan?) Do I have to return the car? Do I get my down payment back? I'm going to talk to the dealer tomorrow but I'm stressing and don't know my options.\nTLDR: Got talked into buying more car than I planned for, and now am not approved for the upgraded loan.

Basically, to answer all those questions, draw up a list of options trying to predict where they'll splinter off into different categories of answers, then ask the dealer, until you arrive at an answer you'd happy with.   \nOkay no I'm kidding.   \nSorry I can't be of more help.  ",
        "answer_1": "\nGot talked into buying more car than I planned for\n\nThen this loan falling through may be a great situation for you. They most likely gave you the car on the condition that the loan would go through (check your paperwork for such a clause). It did not go through. So you can either try to arrange your own financing or else return the car and get your down payment back. I suggest the latter.\nAnd be sure to use this as a learning experience - always know the maximum you can afford, never go over that, and do research on the particular car you are looking at before you buy. Don't simply trust that whatever random car the salesman shows you is fit for your needs.",
        "answer_2": "Talk to the dealer first and foremost and find out who they actually had the loan approved with. If they spot delivered you (delivered without an approval in place), your contracts will show no lienholder assigned, so review them and find out what institution, if any, picked up the note. \nOften, especially with less than perfect credit, we do what's called \"shotgunning\". The finance manager selects 3 to 4 of the most likely banks to get an approval with, then \"shotguns\" your application out to them. Sometimes one picks it up, sometimes, none do, and sometimes they all do. It really depends. The number of banks go up if you have particularly challenged credit. The important thing is that we are required to send you a letter saying you were denied for credit EVEN IF THE BANK APPROVES YOU! If the terms change from what they originally approved (a counter approval) or if you decline to finance with one of the banks, you will get AAN's from any institution that didn't capture your business or captured your business with a counter approval. \nTLDR: Could be an AAN or could have been spot delivered. If it's the former, don't worry about it. If it's the latter, be prepared to have to fight your way out of a contract that claims you owe money for use of the vehicle (typically $50/day,  $0.50/mile in my state)."

If the value after renovations will be $350K (and, an appraiser agrees with this because investing $50K into a house will not likely raise the value $50K) then you can do an FHA 203K rehab loan.

        "prediction": "Chances are they won't get exercised - most brokerages (I know at least TDA and Charles Schwabb do this) will record the earnings announcement on the ex dividend date, so the stock will need to be in the money by the dividend amount (usually $0.10-$0.50) at the close on the ex dividend date to be assigned. This will sell your shares at a profit, but that shouldn't take you too far back since you're also receiving/keeping the premium on the call you sold. \nBy premium expiring you still have this position (call + long share), so if things are still going good with NVDA you can roll, either next month or 260/262 to make some more premium. Since you're collecting credit from selling a non covered call, the position doesn't have unlimited risk so you'll just be losing all collected premiums if NVDA jumps $30 and the call goes in the money.",

        "question": "How true is the \"worst house/best neighborhood\" clich\u00e9? My husband and I are looking to buy a house in Monmouth County, NJ, with hopes of living near the water. Unfortunately you can leave it to New Jersey to turn the shore into slums, so a lot of the towns are either extremely affluent or extremely meth-y.\nWe've been focusing on a town that falls in the middle. Definite split in neighborhoods, mediocre schools, but not terribly inconvenient to NYC where my husband works. Houses in our price range seem to go very quickly.\nToday I decided to switch it up and my realtor took me to a house a little bit inland in one of the most affluent towns with a great school system. The house is small (960 sq feet), directly next to a park, and pretty poorly laid out.\nIf we were to make an offer, we would slowly work on updating different aspects of the house, hopefully eventually adding on a bedroom, additional bathroom, and a laundry room on the second floor. Slowly.\nOn our short list would be knocking down some walls, updating the enclosed front porch, adding central air, and landscaping. I think with these alone, considering comps in the neighborhood we'd add a lot of value to the house, but I'm also a FTHB so what the hell do I know.\nHouse is currently vacant, asking is 299k, homeowners bought the house in '06 for 270k. Based on what I've seen, I can't imagine it's worth more than 260, but again this is a great town with great schools and the lower end houses seem to bear the least of NJ's infamous property tax burden.

        "question": "Why not invest in real estate as a way to generate extra income? If you are starting small with 1 house or a duplex, isn't this a great way to start generating extra income?",
        "prediction": "It can be, but it can also be a pain and unprofitable. I've had 2 experiences. The first one was just me not knowing how to manage a big property with big personalities. The second one was an entire development that was poorly designed and poorly managed. Both made about 1-2% profit per year and were a huge headache. \nI've read articles saying that these poor investments were just poor luck, but I know of too many stories of people either being lazy and ignoring properties or having them mis-managed. Apartments in the US seem to be built with little incentive to maintain them over time. The development I'm part of was built in the 2000s. First tenants in 2011. It's a 10 unit building been falling apart since we closed on it in 2016.",
        "answer_1": "\nWhy not\n\nA few reasons. One, it locks up a considerable amount of capital in a single asset.\nTwo, it's subject to potentially high risk. If you get a difficult-to-evict tenant, then you're still on the hook for HOA/mortgage/utilities while your tenant is both not paying rent and potentially damaging the home.\nThree, it's not as hands-off as you'd think. You have to write invoices, deal with tenant needs, etc. I'm at the point now where I spend maybe 2-4 hours a month on my rental properties (unless I've got a move-in/move-out to attend to). But that's after years of getting things automated to a point I'm happy with.\nFour, long-term asset valuation is difficult. Investing in Detroit real estate probably looked like a brilliant idea back in the 50's. Investing in Vegas and Florida condos was all the rage 10 years ago. Bubbles burst.\nFifth, property appreciation is \"nice,\" but unrealized unless you actually sell. Once you sell, the property is no longer providing any cash flow. Thus, a lot of people invest and end up losing money for years and years.\nReal estate is a useful part of any investment portfolio. However, as 2008 evidenced, being inexperienced can cause it to be a fool's errand. I own a few properties, but I don't think I'll be acquiring any more unless I see a really good deal.",
        "answer_2": "Because it requires a type of work that some people don't enjoy. Some people don't like placing listings or doing major upkeep or market research or paying a property manager to do those things.\nIt also requires a decent amount of money in case you don't have tenants for a few months (or worse yet, you have terrible tenants).

        "question": "Considering buying a home at 30 (USA) I am 30, and am the primary provider for two young kids. I live in a more expensive city because I love the schools and the community. However almost all housing is 300K+. I have no debt, and 750 credit score. I have considered both FHA loans and traditional mortgages. Besides a 2-3 month emergency fund I have nothing saved. I claim both kiddos on taxes which is financially helpful. I make around $17/hour and work full time. I do not plan to move and have also had the same employeer for 4 years. The biggest reason for the push to buy comes from the ever increasing cost of rent. All 2-3 bedroom apartments are easily over $1200/mo, and mine will be soon as well. My parents own, and have offered to help with a downpayment. I can also use my next tax return (7k last year) as part of the downpayment. My rent is $850 and will be raised to $950 or so by next year. At what point should I buy?",
        "prediction": "At that income, 300k is far above the affordability range. I would look at strictly what you can afford or possibly lower if parents are pitching in, instead of where you would like, as well. In reality, 300 to 800. per month isn't that much mortgage wise. You could afford a house near there for 1700. m\u1ed9tth, (larger down payment possible).  A place in the low 100s could be 400. a mo.

        "answer_1": "At $17/hr, assuming the full 2080 standard full time hours per year are worked, you\u2019re making $35k a year.  Most lenders use the 28-36 rule, where your payment (including taxes, insurance, and PMI) needs to be 28% or less of your gross income per month excluding other debt, and 36% including other debt payments.  That taps you out at a mortgage of about $130-$135k.  \nSo assuming the houses in your area are all 300k+, you\u2019ll need to do one of three things:\n1.  Downpayment of at least $170k.\n2. Ability to more than double your income, to at least 80k+.\n3.  Move to an area where houses are cheaper, or wait to buy until you\u2019ve saved up the $170k.  \nI know this sucks because you want a house, but unfortunately the math is what it is.  Is it possible to grow your income?  Could you move further out to a cheaper area and commute?  ",
        "answer_2": "If you make 40K/yr, this house is 7.5x your income.  Rule of thumb on this sub is 2.5 to 3, and that assumes 20% down.\nWith nothing saved, you're an AC repair from credit card debt.\nYou might be able to get approved on FHA, they've put stuff through that completely confused me, but this is way too much house for you.  You spend everything you make now, so making yourself house poor and dramatically increasing your costs has to come from somewhere.  How would you increase your housing costs when you have 0 savings now?\nSounds like you will need another earner in your household before you can afford to buy."

For example, given we are due a recession, you can pick the bottom of the cycle again and pick stocks you think will recover or are oversold.\n\n\nCasinos and so on are a risky industry. From a macro perspective, I'd say cash out. You've stuck at it 8 years, it is time to move on.\n\n\nTry to pick out stocks that are guaranteed to do well as our world economy restructures in the 2020's, or on the other hand, from a micro perspective ones you know something more than the average joe about ;) Ideally not competitive industries.\n\n\nAll the best!"

        "question": "Should I plan to buy my parents an annuity? My parents are getting close to retirement age (60 and 61) and don't have much saved. I haven't discussed exact numbers with them, but I'd estimate they have ~100k in savings. Currently my dad makes ~55k as a truck driver and my mom makes 5-10k part time. They didn't work in the US until age 45, hence the lack of savings. \nThey expect to get 1400/month total from social security once they hit 66. It's not that much, because they won't have been paying in for the full 35 years.\nMy dad thinks he will have to work until he dies. His job is very hard on him -- most driving is at night, his hours are always changing, and he gets very little time off. Coming home for the holidays, I feel very sorry for him. \nI haven't told them, but I'd like to help make it possible for my dad to retire in 5-6 years, around 66. The good news is that their house is paid off, they live in a low cost of living area, and they're reasonably frugal, so if he retired I think they could live on 25-30k/yr. \nI'm 24 and in my 3rd year of grad school working toward a PhD. I live on a 40k/yr stipend, plus about 10k/yr from side jobs. I live with 5 housemates on rice and beans, so I've managed to save ~90k since starting grad school. My income should increase to ~80k/yr when I graduate in 2.5 years, and then hopefully keep increasing slowly if I make it in academia. If I don't, it should increase faster. I don't have any debt. \nSo, the idea I'm considering is: use a large fraction of my savings over the next 5-6 years to buy them an annuity that pays out 1k/month. It appears this would cost me roughly 175k. Combined with social security and their savings, this should hopefully be enough that my dad can retire. This would of course set me back quite a bit in my own finances, but I'm young enough that I think I should still be ok. My parents made big sacrifices career-wise for me and my sister throughout their lives, so I'm willing to take a hit. \nI guess an alternative to buying an annuity would be to just set up an automated transfer to give them 1k/month. I like that the annuity is guaranteed, so they wouldn't have to worry that I would stop giving them money for any reason. I think if I proposed to just send them money every month, they would probably refuse. Same for a lump sum gift. \nDoes this sound like a reasonable plan? Do people still use annuities for retirement? Are there other better ways to help your aging parents? ",

Disclaimer: This may not be the place for this, but regardless...\nSo, I'm a 22y/o male still living at home with my mom in Canada. Graduated high school and got my diploma three years ago but I've been struggling to put my life together past that point. Sometime within that three-year period I came down with a partial disability that severely limits my ability to work.\nBecause of this, I've held numerous jobs (cashier, lubrication technician, server, etc.) but haven't been able to hold them because the physical nature of these jobs was simply too taxing and I was forced to quit. I've tried to get on disability but require a formal diagnosis; EKG and MRI scans have shown an abnormality but nothing that doctors can actually put a name to, and hence, no disability.\nAll of this has put severe financial burden on my mother, who is already poor and now struggling to pay bills for two people in the same house as well as my expenses as I have no income. We're on welfare and struggling to make ends meet and she's about to lose her job come January so I know that I need to get my life together now - and I want to, because the guilt of being so useless and undervalued by my family and the few friends I have is gut-wrenching.\nThrough all of this hardship, my only real reason to live and to get my life together was my girlfriend of three years and my best friend of five.

I took a job recently for an administrative position in the Healthcare industry. The listing highlighted primarily basic administrative assistant functions; however, during training it's become very clear that my responsibilities are substantially different and more integral than just essentially a front desk staffer. (I don't want to go into too much detail of the position on the post but I gladly can describe more responsibilities or give information privately if needed) I negotiated my wages based on the job listing and now I am starting to feel that either there was a listing error and they were excited to accept at a lower rate, or maybe even a bait and switch scenario happened.\nMy main questions are:\n\n\nHow do I properly discuss my salary concerns? Should I go to my boss or HR? How long should I wait - I figure if I approach them too quickly I have no leverage as a trained asset, but if I wait they will be incredulous that I didn't pick up the concern earlier.\n\n\nHow do I figure out the proper salary range for the position? The title is \"administrative support professional\" which is inherently very vague, so I am having a lot of trouble finding a salary range for the actual skills/responsibilities on Glassdoor etc. The best information I have is an older listing from the company that is substantially more accurate to the job. \n\n\nAny guidance would be really appreciated.

If the hospital needs to hire low skilled labor to provide some service to patients, even if the service is highly important or it comes with the title, Head of Whatever, the job isn't going to pay much.\nYour comp is based a lot more on you than the position. You have a value in the marketplace. Not every job is going to be a good fit for you. But if you take a job answering phones and they want you to sweep floors instead, your comp doesn't go down, they're just overpaying you to be a janitor. If you take a job answering phones and they want you to take a bunch of responsibility for other aspects of the business, they're not underpaying you, they're just training you for free to do stuff you're currently unqualified for.

I recommend not buying anything for a while, and plan very carefully.  Pay off credit cards, though.  \n\n\nYea, you can get a cool car and a remodel on the house, etc., but you can also let that money work for you for a while via investments.  When we first got wind of our money, we made a plan, with some of it going towards a $80K Mercedes SUV, etc., and I am now in hindsight so super glad we didn't buy that kind of stuff.  Take your time to really plan - don't just make a list of what you want to buy.\n\n\nYou might be looking at \"Wealth Manager\" more so than \"Financial advisor\", though $1M is maybe a little low for that, I'm not sure.  We shopped around for wealth managers, had some recommendations from friends, etc., but ended up only having a small amount under that control, as kind of a secondary backup plan.  (We ended up with RBC Wealth Management\n\n\nReally get references for advisors and managers, and recognise that they may be looking more out for themselves than for you.\n\n\nRead all you can before making big decisions.  We read every single \"Investment For Dummies\" books.  I actually liked those a lot because the Dummies brand wants to protect their brand more than push an agenda.  Read them all.\n\n\nAnother absolute must read is \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham.  I have literally doubled our money by following this simple advice over about 3 or so years.  You will need to know the basics of investing, per the Dummies books, before reading this, but I strongly recommend it.  (Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's Mentor)\n\n\nConsider that with $1M you can now be an accredited investor.  That means, you can buy into various companies that are not publically traded.  This can be a lot of fun.  Learn about angel investing and the like, find some groups that do it, and if it is of interest to you, be very careful, picky, and spread your risk.   This is not for everyone, though, and very risky.   We personally have small investments ($2K to $15K) spread out over several such investments totaling maybe $50K.  It will be quite a few years before we know if that was a good idea, but they were companies that we felt were doing good in the world, so are okay losing it.\n\n\nKeep it to yourself.  Your friends don't need to know your good fortune.  All that would do is incite jealousy, which really is not something you want, as tempting as it may be.\n\n\nConsider always keeping a reserve so you can quit your job at any moment.  Having the knowledge that you always have that freedom may make your job more fun.  \n\n\nDon't forget others.  Share some of your good fortune.  Invest in the world around you.\n\n\nHope something here is of some help.  Congratulations on your good fortune.",

Do your research on any advisor, ask them how they're paid (avoid any advisor that is paid by commission such as the one you mentioned you'd seen). Look for someone who will charge you a 'fee for service', preferably someone from an independent firm too. \nFind out if there is an industry body with a professional standard of conduct and education like the FPA in Australia.

I guess I'll start by saying I blame no one for this but myself and I want to do everything possible to manage these loans. The bulk of my loans have been consolidated and are federal loans (70k consolidated. Currently doing income based repayment, these payments start next month)\nNow for the shitty part... I have 30k in private loans (gasp). 20k is to Sallie Mae and another 10k is actually a private loan from my university (How the hell I let that happen is beyond me. Freshman year I accepted the university's assistance because I could not pay my tuition. I was under the impression  this was another federal loan until my university called me yesterday to inform me payments were due in June). I called my university today in an attempt to sort this loan out and consolidate it... which failed miserably. \nI'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and helpless at the moment and I wish to change that. \nMy sallie mae payments start in May and will be 400 a month. My private university loan is due in june and will be 213 a month.\nI can expect another 200 a month in federal loan repayments. \nWith 800 a month coming out for student loans and an estimated 1000 dollars in monthly expenses, I can afford to exist and that's about it. \nI realize that this is the worst my situation will ever be (ideally). I will get established and my degree does have value (Environmental Science) I finally have my foot in the door at a company who will train me well and at the very least, make me more employable.\nDo I just ride this out and budget like I've never budgeted before? I am only making 15/hr right now but it is full time with decent health insurance, this pay will ideally increase to 20+ in 3-6 months when I am properly trained and coherent in my position. Im sure my situation is not unique and I'm sure many people have felt their debt was insurmountable. \nWhat can I do now to set myself up to succeed?

I'm 21 and work as a receptionist in Minneapolis for a luxury apartment business. I make $10 an hour, at a base of 30 hours a week. I've been working there for six months and because we're short staffed I've almost always hit around 45-60 hours a week with some great overtime. My best friend and I are eyeballing a few apartments in the cities that are around 900 or so a month, with us splitting the bill down the middle. I bring home about 1,300 monthly when I'm only getting minimum hours.\nI currently live at home with my mother and 22 year old brother. Both of us are taking a few years off of college (I have no college debt just yet to worry about) to save up money and get our ducks in a row. My main concern with moving out is not how I can manage financially, but how I can manage both my rent and her rent at the same time.\nMy mother is absolutely terrible with money. We live in a trailer with $580 rent, and she's always supported us with a boyfriend's income, or by borrowing money. She's been an artist her whole life and doesn't have many other job skills at 57 years old. She's also recently in remission for breast cancer and I can't let her overwork herself since she's at risk for relapse if she gets too stressed. I feel responsible for her since she's very scatter-brained and I'm concerned that she can't make it on her own since she's never had to do so before. \nMy brother and I pay most of the bills. She gets $700 a month for unemployment, but that won't cover the debt she's gotten herself into over the years, along with two cars and a huge electricity bill.  I think I make enough to survive on my own (especially with a roommate), but I need advice about how to deal with a dependent parent.\nTL;DR: Desperately want to move out of the nest, but don't know how to keep myself and my mother financially stable.

Anybody can learn to run a cash register. \nSee if there are county services for assistance in finding jobs especially for older/displaced workers. \nIf you are adamant about supporting her yourself, you need substantially better income.

        "question": "Cash only apartment, how to protect myself? My husband and I have lived in our apartment for about 7 years.  It is a small complex, managed by an almost retired guy on behalf of his mother who is the owner.  She's pretty old and he is set to inherit the place when she finally dies.  Since it's a family owned thing we were told at the beginning to pay rent with cash, since it was easy for them.\nWe have been excellent tenants, in general the whole complex is very quiet and polite, and we have never been late with our rent or had any problems with them.  However, we are sensing that there may be some changes coming and the ownership/management of the complex might be handed down to the next generation son, who we do not like or trust.     At all! \nNothing bad has happened yet, but two very established families suddenly moved recently and we are a little concerned about the changes we see.  \nOur lease is month to month and we have never gotten rent reciepts, as it's difficult to even pay the property manager directly and we usually end up giving the money to his sweet old mother in law who also lives there and collects all the rent money for him.\nI'm also pretty sure they don't report to credit agencies, which kind of stinks for us. \nSo having briefly explained the situation, herein lies my questions:\nHow can I protect my family in case something bad happens?  Also, how can I get proof of our rent history to submit to our credit agencies?\nI'm aware that having bank statements proving we took out rent money each month is not probably enough evidence to  prove we have been paying every month.  Is there some kind of document I can have the property manager sign that proves we have been excellent (paying on time) tenants?\nWhat's the best way to ask for such a document without raising undue concern or suspicion?\nAlso, we are located in California fyi.\nI know there's a lot of questions in here, hopefully someone has some answers or advice, or experience!

He can\u2019t risk people paying by check, then canceling their checks when they are unhappy the place.\nThat said, I think he sound like a super nice guy. If he\u2019s trying to get a lot more for this complex than its market valuation, there won\u2019t be a new complex owner.

        "question": "Is our love for options pathological? I used to be a stonks kind of a guy. I thought i was a genius for making $10 off holding some stocks for a week and then selling them. Slowly but surely, i made about $300 in profit trading stonks fairly frequently with a capital of $1k in 5-6 months, which is great.\nThen i discovered this subreddit, and slowly became dissatisfied with my 30% gains on stonks when i could be making 3000% like some of you autists.\nI started trading options in September and i have already lost $1.5k... but i don\u2019t feel anything? I fee empty of any sadness towards my loss. I just want to keep refilling my account and trying again, even though i am literally a fucking braindead fish when it comes to options. Literally almost every trade i do blows up in my face.\nI am starting to get worried about myself. Is this pathological? Am i just using options and money to mask other shit in my life like being a fucking loser?\nDo you guys think options also feel pathological for you?",

You\u2019re normal and it\u2019s normal to have a wide variety of motivations for why you want to trade, some healthy and some not-so-much.

It\u2019s like golf; you could spend all your time betting he\u2019ll miss and maybe not put in as much effort in the things that increase your own percentage of hole-in-two success.\nStonks is the same; I use options to minimize losses if I\u2019m not fully confident if I\u2019m going to win.  Sure, that\u2019s not the mindset most traders have - the wall street trader who\u2019s on the floor looking at stamps he\u2019s never going to get more than 3-4 seconds in order to bet on whether looking up at the sky will give him a better perspective on what\u2019s going on.\nIt\u2019s all how you look at it, and by comparison to other pursuits, it\u2019s likely quite healthy.

There are no guarantees, no amount of research will ever allow you to get even close to a 100% amount of gains, but it will ever happen. \nYou are making the correct choice in a target date index fund or fund of funds. Mutual funds will, barring small returns that you see on paper and index funds will be lower to make up for the admin costs and high failure rates. You could pick and choose an own mix of index funds, but it's far simpler, easier and smoother to go it with target retirement funds so long as they're low cost. In an advantage of target date index funds to normal ones is that they automatically shift their weightings in trying to predict where the prospects of return will be the best vs the risks that arise from investing in them in order to ensure maximum return for a minimum risk. Presents zero complexity and if you're under 40 years if age it's likely that you won't be too bad shape assuming a reasonable percent of revenue is going towards retirement. You're on a great start, looking into retirement these days is like 30% if the battle to being on the right path. Being under 40 allows you to increase what you may be putting away for retirement in the next 10-15 years, as well as further contributing if time is needed after that. If you're spending 25-35% long term in your career putting that away for retirement, plus risk based investments like 401k matching and whatnot, I think the the least of your worries is a slight difference of 1% between specific options the two places offer. \u09ac\u09bf\u098f \u09a8\u09be\u0987 \u09ac\u09c1\u09b2\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7!\n",

        "question": "Wife\u2019s company is offering a new benefit that seems too good to be true. What am I missing? My wife works for a publicly traded company. They are implementing a new benefit this year and you have to enroll this month. The way it works is you set an amount you want to contribute each paycheck up to $10,000 total every six months. Then at the end of the six months your amount is used to purchase the company\u2019s stock at 15% off of whatever the lowest price the stock had been during the period, issued to you immediately. You can of course then either sell the stock immediately at the current market price or hold onto it indefinitely. This will be repeated until further notice.\nI can\u2019t see a reason why I wouldn\u2019t just have her max out the contribution and then sell the stock  immediately when it\u2019s issued for a minimum bonus of $1500. What am I missing?\nAlso, why would the company do this? They have 10\u2019s of thousands of employees, if many did this wouldn\u2019t the sell off hurt the stock price?",

Logically, the company doesn't have direct levers to try to increase the stock price if they themselves are issuing stock at below market price (though they would look to report a healthy earnings statement to keep the price from dropping off).\nThe idea is that he company trying to drive up ownership of the stock, thus the company also rises. Honestly, your best strategy is to buy and hold unless you know that there's a steady downtrend. Foolish billionaires have a long done research into how people around them make more money while they have more money, so they enact measures to make sure they're contributing to that increased wealth.\n\nAlso, why would the company do this?

You should definitely take full advantage of this program.",

But I want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. \nWhat is a credit freeze?\nA credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. It protects you against identity theft. Even if a hacker knows all your info, including your SSN, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. Now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. Once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.\nOther replies:\nWhy is this news important now?\nMany experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. Starting Friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. In the wake of a massive data breach last year at Equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million Americans, Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. Equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. [The bill was passed in May](  [It is effective as of today.]( \nHow can I do it?\nTo set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: \n[Experian]( \n[Equifax]( \n[TransUnion](  \n[ChexSystems]( \n[Innovis] ( \n[NCTUE] ( \nYou will be given a PIN that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. \nDo I have to do this with all credit agencies? I only have one credit card\nYes you do. Your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. \nDoes this mean that I can freeze my credit score at 810? Does freezing affect my score?\nNo. A credit freeze only freezes who can see your credit record. Your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. Freezing does not affect your score.\nIs credit unfreeze/thaw also free?\n[Yes.]( \nHow long does the \u201cthaw\u201d process takes before credit is available to be pulled?\nIf you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.\nWhat if I lose my PIN?

        "answer_1": "A cheap BMW will cost you a fortune unless you are buying it as a project and you know how to work on it. Run. \nNot sure why you'd want to lease something unless you are using it as a tax writeoff or you know you will want a new car every 3 years forever. ",
        "answer_2": "BMWs require a lot of maintenance, not an issue of you're mechanically inclined, but very costly if you aren't. \nAdditionally, these year  3 series requires an overhaul of the entire cooling system at 100K miles.\nIt would be cheaper for you to find something else."

        "question": "Leaving company and just found out I have gone negative with my vacation time. I am leaving my current job and just found out from HR that I will be invoices for 19 hours of PTO that I have not officially accrued yet. The problem is the time off system we use (Kronos) does not show what my actual accruals to date are. I have no way to see this information. Obviously if I was going negative I would not have used time I had not earned, especially as I was going through my job search knowing I\u2019d likely be leaving soon. \nSalaried position so never got any overtime for working nights/weekends. I\u2019ve worked well over 19 extra hours just over the course of the past month alone which is the frustrating part. \nIs there anything I can do here to avoid owing this company any money?",
        "prediction": "Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to point an overly zealous finger. But, did you check your leave balances regularly and caused this mess yourself? If so, not sure there is much you can do to get out of it. Presumably there is some sort of CBA that governs unpaid wages and fringe benefits. \nBy way of fairness to the employer, and btvla from experience, they have a right to get paid for benefits given to employees that, in essence and indexable to a flexible type of wage.",
        "answer_1": "Nope.  If they can show that you earned X hours of vacation but you used more than that, you WILL owe them the back pay.  There is nothing you can do if they insist that you owe them.  You can either hold off leaving until you have accrued those hours or chalk it up to experience and take the hit.  Hopefully your moving to the new job comes with a raise to help account for this.",
        "answer_2": "\nIs there anything I can do here to avoid owing this company any money?\n\nUnfortunately not.  It's a very common practice, and in all likelihood stated in 30 odd pages we all signed and didn't read when we start.  \nYour decision on whether you want to ignore them...I'm not a lawyer or in HR but I can think of one friend who did end up having legal chase them down over it."

        "question": "Dad just died, my mother (57) cant take of herself. Only child. Where to begin? My dad has been drinking heavily the past 6 months. His way of coping with my mothers mental illness. Yesterday he had a heart attack and now he has passed. I have no clue what to do. I've barely spoken to either of them the past 5 years.

I would appreciate any help. Im still at the hospital as im typing this. I dont believe there is a will either.\nEdit:\n1. We live in California, i live close enough to her to help. But i will not be moving in or have her move in with me.\n2. A social worker did not talk to us at hospital before we left, i suppose i will call back Monday morning and get assistance.\n3. Since its the holiday weekend everything is closed. But ive talked to a funeral home and they will be picking up my father Tuesday morning and cremating him for around $800.\n4. My mother has kaiser and has not seen a doctor in over a year. I plan on taking her asap next week. I also believe she gets state disability already. She is also not objecting of me taking over the bills and finances.\n5. I also will be seeing a probate lawyer next week as soon as i can. Their bills seem to be in order, everything is payed for the this month like mortgage, insurances, water and pge. All the vehicles and motorcycles are payed off also. \nI want to thank everything for the help and kind wishes. It has helped out tremendously. If you feel im missing anything still, im all ears. I hope everyone has a great Holiday.",
        "prediction": "When my mom passed my grandma couldn't live alone. At first she was just really dazed, so we had nursing in. She couldn't walk more then 3 steps without getting dizzy. In addition we set up meals on wheels to come in, did some modification to make her home more livable. Luckily my sister was a nursing student and always went to go check in.",
        "answer_1": "Talk to a social worker at the hospital about adult social services for your mom and legal advice for you about how to handle your dad's estate going forward. I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "answer_2": "You have two choices when it comes to your mother:\n1) Be there until the end of her days. You become her full-time carer\n2) You have someone do it for yo  in old people's home.\nI'm not gonna go in and ask about mental illnesses but if she's not aware of her surroundings as much as she used to, putting in a people's home with professional carers etc is the best outcome, because it will impact your life and probably put it on a standstill if you decide to care for you mother 24/7"
