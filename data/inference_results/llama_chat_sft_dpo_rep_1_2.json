        "prediction": " Staying with them until you can find another job and leaving sounds like your best bet here:\n\nHowever, I think they are misclassifying me because... They give me \"projects\" to make it seem like I'm a contractor, but I still don't think it is.\n\nYou believe you are misclassified as a 1099 contractor when in fact you would be considered an employee if you were paid through regular employment channels. This means that not only does the company owe you unpaid taxes on the money they've been saving by treating you as a contractor (since you wouldn't get W-2 income), but also that you could potentially sue them over this issue once you land a new gig where they won't be able to try to skirt labor laws so easily.",

        "question": "[INST] ELI5: Why do banks lend at such a low rate for mortgages? On PF we often talk about earning 7% on stocks, or 5% on bonds in the long run. If bonds for example are a fairly safe investment, why would any lender bother to sell a mortgage that only earns say 3.125%, when they could invest it somewhere else for a higher return? Especially once you consider that mortgages have some overhead (paying loan officers, accounting systems, advertising, etc) and significant risk of default.\nObviously lenders aren't idiots, so how do they make a good return lending at such low rates? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Because there is no other place where anyone can get those 3.125%. In fact, most people who want money will pay someone to borrow their money rather than the reverse!\nThe problem with your analogy is that it assumes all things equal - what if everyone wanted to buy a bond instead of taking out a mortgage? Well then the interest rates on bonds would go up until enough people were willing to take out mortgages again. The reason bankers don't mind giving out loans like this is because there are always more people wanting to take them out than there are people offering to give money away.",
        "answer_1": "Several reasons:\n\nTheir cost of funding is very low (e.g. savings account interest)\nThey invest with scale (many mortgages/c&i loans/credit card/etc.)\nThe loans are secured by the property \nThe risk of investing in the equity markets is much, much higher than secured lending\nIn many cases they do not even hold the mortgages, merely package them for the government (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie) to securitize and sell to investors  \n",
        "answer_2": "There is a huge secondary market for mortgages. So the bank that lends you the money for your home can turn around and resell that mortgage to GNMA or FNMA (or others). They can then keep a small amount of the percentage going past (say .125%) and the risk of holding the note now belongs to someone else. And GNMA can repackage and sell the mortgages bundled into bonds that pay 3%. "

So first we called scrap and salvage yards in our area to see if anything would come up and still waiting on confirmation from that.

        "prediction": " Yes, absolutely 100% yes.\nIt will not increase your rates at all. Insurance companies love you when you file claims. The only reason they might care is if there are multiple unreported incidents like this over time, which sounds unlikely given what you said.",

        "answer_2": "Probably not worth it to file an insurance claim, but definitely file a police report.  If anything had a serial number, the cops will be able to search for that if the item is ever found.  Would mean additional charges on the thief, which would be worth it."

        "question": "[INST] Should I cancel my whole life policy My parents bought a whole life insurance policy when I was born and transferred it to me a while back. I have been paying the premiums but I recently read a few posts here about how it may not be worth it. Here is the info I have on the policy, I would appreciate your input. Thank you.\n$25,000 whole life policy with Security Benefit Life Insurance with options every 5 years to increase coverage (10k I believe).\nPremiums: $8.50/month\nCurrent policy value if I cash out: $850\nReduced paid-up insurance (whatever that means): $13,000 \nI am 28, married, 1 child, and I have sufficient term life insurance through my employer. I have a pre-existing condition that might make it hard to get life insurance later on, but it shouldn't affect my lifespan. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Nope - this isn't even close to being worthwhile for you. The current annual cost of the policy ($96) exceeds its accumulated value by over $700!\nYou should cancel the policy immediately and take your money elsewhere.",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the life insurance industry. Under no circumstances do you cancel that policy before you have another in place, even if you have term through work. Most new policies have a \"contestability period\" where if you pass away, your family can receive only the premiums paid into the policy depending on how you died. After the contestability period ends, the insurance company has to pay the insurance value of the policy.\nWhole life is meant to cover solely funeral expenses, something your family will have to pay for no matter how long you live. Term is meant to cover short term needs like income replacement, mortgage, child care expenses if your wife has to go back to work if you die unexpectedly, etc. \nPaid-up insurance means you are guaranteed $12,000 of life insurance for the rest of your life in exchange for forfeiting the $800+ cash you would get if you cancelled the policy. And you wouldn't have to pay another dime. I would love to see a modern day policy where you can get $12,000 future money for your family in exchange for paying $800 now. It doesn't exist for a 28yr old with a pre-existing condition. \nThe other wonderful thing about paid-up policies, especially the older ones (you'll have to check the way the policy itself is written) is that after a certain number of years they often start earning cash value again. Pretty much the insurance company takes that $800 cash value, reinvests it, and it makes them money. The old policies \"rewarded\" the policy holder for that by paying interest(dividends) back onto the policy in the form of additional cash value. Which you can then use to increase the insurance value of the policy if you choose to. \nYours isn't old enough to work quite as well as this example, but I've seen policies that were originally bought to cover maybe $500 or so, the policy holder paid about $50 in premiums before the policy became fully paid, and when they finally passed, their family got a few thousand dollars. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of money, but if you pay more attention to the growth, that's approximately a 4000% growth on the original premiums. \nIf your patient and maintain a whole life policy correctly, especially one that was taken out when you were a child, those things can pay back a lot of extra money when you pass than what was originally paid into them in premiums. \nMy recommendation is to find someone who can walk you though all the specific options of your policy. If it is an insurance agent, make it extremely clear that you have no interest in exchanging it for a new policy (even if you are thinking about it in real life), you just want to understand how it works and your different options. A lot of insurance agents still work on commission, so do not let one of them try to pressure you into cashing it out in favor of a brand new policy. Not all of them are like that, but there are some that only care about their sales goals and not what's best for you and your family. ",
        "answer_2": "Why not go to an investment advisor and ask for a free comparison? Most advisors are also in the insurance business or have a business partner who is...\nFor that matter, why not go to a second advisor after that? Compare notes on what they can do for you and think about it. \nRemember that new life insurance has a \"free look\" window, so you can keep the old whole life policy for a little while, as you consider you're options. I, for one, would tell you to keep your current policy as is, but an advisors job is to gather all the pertinent questions and give you a straight answer.\nOne important question: Have you considered family insurance?"

        "prediction": "\nFor example, how much per year can we expect the first 5 years?\n\nA ballpark figure for a child's early life is: $230K to $470K (before college) depending on whether you choose to include higher education costs in that estimate. Here's where those figures come from:\n$16,000 - $28,000 annually for food ($1,900-$3,300 monthly), clothing, personal care items, etc., which should be about half what your own household spending looks like now.\n$2,000-\u00a33,000 annually for health insurance, plus whatever additional out-of-pocket medical expenses may arise during this period. You might pay more than this if your employer doesn't offer good coverage, but many people with children get very generous benefits through their jobs.\n$5,000-\u00a310,000 annually for childcare; this will depend largely on how long you work full time while raising little ones. It could also depend on your decision regarding nannies vs. daycares. If both parents plan to work outside the home, then at least one parent must find some kind of non-home childcare arrangement -- either because they need to commute to work each day or because there isn't enough space in the house to accommodate an infant along with other family members who still want to sleep there at night. Daycare arrangements tend to run around $1,000 to $2,000 per month, although the actual amount varies widely by region and quality level. Nanny salaries range from $15/hour to nearly twice as much again. The average rate nationwide is around $18/hr. This adds up to roughly $2,000 to $4,000 per month. In addition to these direct costs, consider that childcare tends to eat into your income tax refund check even further than typical consumer goods since childcare expenses aren't deductible.\n$2,000-\u00a35,000 annually for diapers & wipes alone! Add another $2,000-\u00a33,000 for clothes, shoes, socks, underwear, and miscellaneous accessories such as hats, scarves, bibs, burp cloths, blankets, stuffed animals, books, puzzles, games, blocks...\n$2,000-\u00a35,000 annually for baby gear including cribs, changing tables, high chairs, strollers, car seats, monitors, bouncy seats, bathing equipment, bottle warmers, pacifiers, breast pumps, swings, play yards, activity centers...\n$1,000-\u00a33,000 annually for nursery furniture and decorations.\n$5,000-\u00a310,000 annually for toys and activities. Many parents spend a lot here. Some have a hard time stopping themselves once they start buying things \"for the future\". Others feel guilty when their friends ask them over for dinner and don't bring any presents for their hostesses' tiny guests. Your mileage may vary.\n$1,000-\u00a33,000 annually for school supplies if you decide to homeschool later or send your child(ren) off to preschool/kindergarten instead of waiting until elementary school starts.\nIf you live near family, you won't necessarily see increased housing costs due to adding new family members. However, transportation costs may increase significantly, especially if your extended family lives far away. Also, vacation budgets may shrink somewhat unless you manage to combine trips with relatives whose presence would otherwise make traveling together difficult.

A kid comes along one day and suddenly $100 less per week eating out doesn't seem so bad anymore.",
        "answer_1": "typical rule is 3-4x combined annual income. so the house would be in that range. But the term being able to \"afford\" something varies so much case to case.

As someone who just bought a house in a similar range, all the online estimators are wrong, but its easy to get a better estimate.\nMake sure you understand how much homeowners insurance will be. Its very possibly higher than you think.\nMake sure you understand how much taxes will be. Your county has an online tax estimator. Don't look at historical tax payments as florida's \"save our homes\" law prevents them from going up until the house is sold. \nUsing orange county's tax estimator it looks like your taxes will be 4500-5500$ per year with homestead exemption.\nBetween homeowners, taxes, and PMI, you are looking at roughly 600-800$ more per month on top of the mortgage.\nAlso make sure you understand the total amount of money you will need to bring to the table for closing costs (this includes not just the downpayment and loans fees etc but also the money you need to put into escrow which is a significant amount of money. If orlando market is anything like South FL its competitive enough at the 300-350 range that many sellers aren't willing to pay closing."

I was just informed that my company will be suspending our 401(k) effective immediately for a certain number of people designated as \"highly compensated employees\".

When too much of the total plan participation is owned by the company's top earners it is called a \"top-heavy plan\" and loses IRS tax advantages unless the company makes a correction. Based on what you put in your post, I'm wagering that an end of year audit revealed that the plan is top-heavy and now the company is taking steps to correct this imbalance.\nWhat it ultimately amounts to, is that your fellow colleagues that earn less than you are not participating in the 401k as much as you and your fellow high-earners. Without knowing more about your specific income I can't recommend any specific actions, but if you can contribute to an IRA for 2017 right now is a good time to do so.\nQuestions to ask your employer benefits administrator: Was this change due to the plan becoming top-heavy? Will the company be making direct contributions for the non-highly compensated employees to bring total participation into compliance? Will the company be looking at other options to increase plan participation among lower level employees, such as increased matching rates, company-wide performance bonuses, or a broad look at increasing compensation for lower income employees?",

If all you had were $100,000 in debts and equity, then yes, debt would expand at a higher rate since you could borrow against both types of capital. But once you get past that point, growth rates should be roughly equal assuming similar profit margins and such.\n3) What actually drives high equity prices is that companies tend to reinvest profits into their businesses, rather than pay them out to shareholders via dividends. That means they don't just sit around collecting interest income from their bonds; instead, they keep building factories, buying up competitors, etc., which increases earnings over time.",

Is there a way I can combine them to get enough on a down payment for another car?\nBonus question: Anyone have tips on how to negotiate with insurance companies for a higher payout?

        "prediction": " No gap coverage means no gap coverage.  You do not need your insurer to \"negotiate\" you more money because of gap coverage.  \nThe fact they think the vehicle has value above its loan balance tells me their appraisal process is bullshit.  If you want to dispute that valuation, start by getting an independent appraisal done.",
        "answer_1": "You're not going to get anything for a down payment on a replacement vehicle if you're upside down in a car loan, period.  So there's no point in negotiating unless you can get the insurance payout to be MORE than you owe on the car WITHOUT the gap insurance.\nIf you owe $4500 on a car worth $4000 and it's totaled, you will get a payout of $0.  All gap insurance does is prevent you from still having to pay that last $500 on a car that no longer exists.  The hard truth is that you have no equity in your car for the insurance company to pay out.",
        "answer_2": "If you can get your insurance to pay more than $4500, you keep the extra and can use it as a down payment.  If your insurance pays $4500 or less, gap will make up the difference but you won't have any extra for a downpayment.\nOdds are if your car is worth $3500-4000 you are unlikely to be able to negotiate a settlement of over $4500.  But wait and see what their offer is, if they come in higher than expected you might be able to get a few hundred."

Let themselves be delisted\nSeems like they voted for a reverse stock split, but didn't have enough votes - that's out the window. \nThe company has enough cash on hand to operate until the end of the year. Therefore, bankruptcy is unlikely. Again, not impossible, but unlikely.\nNow, the company has the option of dropping great news which would cause the stock to possibly gain value to a dollar. However, they would need to sustain the stock price of a dollar for 10 straight days. With news dropping, this seems unlikely. As it would probably jump to a dollar and then immediately drop back down.\nNow, the following events have led me to believe that the likeliest scenario is a buyout, partnership, or merger. First, the company deleted all of its Twitter and Facebook posts from its respective accounts. Additionally, there has been radio silence from a PR perspective. Second, company leadership recently sold shares and declared it via SEC form 4's -- apparently done for tax purposes, but it is believed that these may have been vested shares. Lastly, the company filed an 8-K today which sold preferred stock which could imply the company is selling convertible debt.

Such as new tenants (maybe old friends son wants to get out on own) or having a nest egg if it went unrented for months without anyone there.\nNobody likes rent going up, so I assume the original renters won't be so cool if the rates raise. \nFor me though, if the renters have been  there for this long and are good.

        "prediction": " Your rule of thumb is:\n A home payment (including principal, interest, taxes and insurance) should not exceed 30% of your take-home pay.\nThe \"back end\" ratios are more flexible:\nA debt-to-income ratio (DTI) should not exceed 41%. This means that all your non-housing monthly debts cannot add up to more than 41% of your gross income.\nSo, if you have $5,000 / mo gross salary after taxes:\n$5k x.3 = $1500 max for housing costs\n$1500 x.41 = $625 max for other debts",
        "answer_1": "Bear in mind your mortgage is only a portion of your home expenses. Your Principle, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance (PITI) is a better estimation of home expenses. And then comes maintenance (a good rule of thumb is 1% of your home's cost per year averaged out over many years). \nLenders will potentially lend up to 50% of your gross for your PITI plus other debt (credit cards, car loans, student loans, etc). Some exceptions for even higher numbers. Some lenders will cut you off in the 43-45. You will also hear terms like front end and back end rations. The former deals with just the PITI while the latter considers all debt. For just your PITI, often cited numbers are 28% and 35%, or even 1/3rd. And then you have those who recommend you budget based on net income (usually 25% of net for the very conservative recommendations). \nSo should you go with 35% or more of your gross or 25% of your net? The answer really depends on your budget. Going over 25-30% of your gross will hurt your ability to save or spend elsewhere. But at the end of the day, the amount you can afford is determined by your spending habits. If you like to spend a lot on hobbies or vacations, 25% of your net may be too high. If you never go out, never go on vacation, and never spend, then maybe numbers beyond 35% of your gross make sense. \nThe short answer? Don't go over 25-30% of your gross on PITI without being absolutely sure it fits within your budget and is in line with your financial goals. Any number below 25-30% of your gross is probably fine if it fits your budget.",
        "answer_2": "Here are the things you should add up when you're considering a mortgage:\n\nMortgage Base Payment\nMonthly tax on your home\nInsurance monthly cost\nHOA Fees\nUtilities (Heating/Cooling, Gas, Electricity, Water, Internet etc.)\n\nIf you want to be living comfortably, I personally believe that all that added shouldn't exceed 30-35% of your total Gross monthly income. Now some people push it and say it should be 30-35% after income tax is cut however that might be pushing it. In some cases, it might be even closer to 40% however the move above you go, the more you have to worry about being pushed towards the edge. I wouldn't recommend it go over 40% because you'll be squeezing your retirement funds because of it. So ideally try keeping it below 30-35% of your total gross income and I think most folks will be fine."

        "prediction": " It isn't so much a matter of them wanting you to give X dollars as it being an issue with taxes and accounting for charities.\nThe way non-profits get their funding (for tax purposes) is by receiving contributions, which can include grants or other forms of income, in addition to what people like us call 'contributions'. The difference between those two types of funds comes down to whether or not the organization has control over where the money goes - if they do, then it's considered a grant rather than a contribution. \nContributions have to meet certain criteria before they become deductible from a contributor's taxable income. One major requirement is that the contributor must have no say at all in who gets the money. This means that anytime someone gives more than $250 during a calendar year, the recipient has to provide written acknowledgement to both the giver and the IRS within 30 days showing exactly how the money was used. If this doesn't happen, the donor cannot claim a deduction for that gift come April 14th.  \nSo, since most small donations aren't going directly towards anything specific, these places will often require larger minimums because otherwise they would end up having to send out thousands of tiny receipts every time someone gave less than $250. Instead, they make everyone go through one big form that shows all of the individual transactions together; each $5 contribution counts toward that overall total even though the organization didn't actually spend any portion of it specifically on something you wanted to support.",

        "question": "[INST] Being debt free finally feels real I am a long time reader first time poster. Would like to thank the community for all the wonderful information and inspiration. Some of the stories really kept me going.\nBackground:\nMale 34 not married.\nFriends thought i was weird for going on this journey.\nPaid off approximately 60K over 4 years (student loan, car, credit card, family loan). \nIncome was approximately $65K before tax.\nHave fully funded emergency fund of 6 months.\nContributing 15% to 401k.\nOpened and full funded a Roth this year. :)\nStarting to save for a house down payment.\nI used the Dave Ramsey method for the most part but I chose to save up a fully funded emergency fund before finishing off my last debt. Which was a loan from my family that I continued paying off monthly. The company i was working for at the time was not very stable so I put a higher value on having cash in the bank vs being debt free. \nOn Sept 2nd 2015 i finally felt safe enough to pay off the last 8K of debt. Hell Ya I am debt free. :) At this point I raised my 401K contributions to 15% from 6% as recommended.\nSo, the strange part for me was that I really did not feel very different after being officially deft free. I still feel very conservative with money and guilty about eating out or buying something nice for myself.\nOne of the things I wanted to do when I finished my journey was to give the Total Money Makeover book or FPU to those who could use it and showed interest.  I am excited to report that on Tuesday I gifted my first copy of the book to a friend who is a single mother working multiple jobs and still struggling with her finances.  After giving her the book for some reason it really hit me that I was debt free and also had a positive net-worth!  \nWhen I got home that night I logged into Vanguard and funded the remainder of my Roth  and opened a taxable account so I can start investing part of my future pay. Still trying to decide on how I want to celebrate. ;)\nDo you have any advice about being less conservative with money after becoming debt free?

She went to the local back and opened an IRA. Fast forward 17 years and as life has slowed down around her, she noticed she hadn't got a statement on that account for some time. After going to the bank, they had no record of the deposit or the IRA.\nObviously this was unsettling, combine that with the fact that it was 17 years ago and that my mom has to prove she deposited the money. My mother even remembered the teller that set it up for her, dates, and times. It was literally the most money she had ever had.\nThe first place we looked for help was FutureFund. I got a hold of an advisor and explained the situation. Since mom hadn't worked there in sometime, she wasn't in there system and we couldn't create an account for her. Their records don't go back that far, so they referred us to the IRS.\nThe IRS is incredibly hard to get ahold of, but we finally got an advisor. Their records only go back 10 or so years and they referred us to the Social Security office. The Social Security office advisor couldn't help, but thought if we came in and filled out some paperwork, (and paid the fees involved) that we might be able to get some sort of information about the deposit.\nI really don't know what to do now or how to get a copy of the check that was deposited in the bank.

        "answer_2": "Yes you absolutely should. SDCCU blows away every other bank I've ever used. The only time I've used another bank is when they offered me $300 or $500 to open up an account with them for a minimum of 3 months (Wamu did this, and Chase did this). So I did, then closed the account. I made $800 that way and they've learned their lesson.\nSDCCU isn't profit driven in the sense that all on paper profit is used to keep customer rates artificially low or expand their business - none of it is paid out to investors because there are none. They actually had the best brick-and-mortar mortgage terms every time I've financed and refinanced. Wells Fargo matched SDCCU except they tacked on $5K in closing fees for fictional things with fancy names - which SDCCU charged \"zero\" for. Other banks were even worse.\nThe only better choices for a mortgage/refi were online banks, where you take on a bit of risk because they can be flaky and can't be easily contacted for a problem (co-worker had his payments bounce with an online bank because the servicer changed mailing address and didn't even tell him, costing him real money and time).\nThe only disadvantage I ran into is SDCCU charged more for international wire transfer fees, than my wife's bank, which is not something most people will run into. But my wife's bank more than compensated by other shenanigans not unlike the Wells Fargo scandal.\nSDCCU does not do any of the BS Wells Fargo does. I have never had to speak to a single SDCCU employee about my money except when I initiated contact about something I wanted, and not a single change has ever happened to my accounts without my asking for it. They have never made a single mistake with my accounts, in 14 years.\nAlso, their employees are great. I have never felt any sales pressure from them. In fact, I've always felt their sales members were not aggressive enough. Always polite in informing me that my pre-approval has now expired just let them know if I want to try again some time. Very laid back.\nA world of difference with my wife's bank (first BoA, then Citi). Lots of WTF moments of getting new accounts we never asked for, getting screwed on rates on auto-renewal, etc.. I had to personally call them every 9 months to put my wife's money stored in CDs back into one of a higher rate because they will always auto-renew into the shittiest rate possible.

        "answer_1": "It doesn't. It's obvious once you think about it, but credit scores are based on credit, or extending people money. Landlords don't lend you money, so even if your landlord was a big corporation which leased rooms and you paid by certified checks, it wouldn't help your credit.\nAs noted, it can hurt your score if you miss a utility payment - I suppose the reasoning is if you can miss a utility payment, you might miss a credit/loan payment as well.",

The only way they can directly access your checking or savings account is by obtaining a court order giving them authority to garnish wages or seize assets.\nIf there are funds available to satisfy a judgment, then they will usually seek either of two things:\n1) Garnishment - which requires employers to send over part of each paycheck until the debt is satisfied, or\n2) Seizure of assets - which means they file paperwork telling your bank(s) to turnover any cash on hand plus any future deposits up to what's needed to cover the judgment.\nThe first method doesn't affect investments at all, while the second method might not even apply depending on how the assets are held (i.e., whether they're jointly owned).",
        "answer_1": "Well 401ks are exempt from most forms of garnishment [by law](  so that's pretty much all there is to it. Debt collectors would be in deep shit if they tried. Not all investment accounts are qualified retirement accounts under that law though, so if you did have money in a taxable brokerage account they could go after it. \nI'm not sure exactly what the philosophy is but I assume it's that retirement income in old age is intended to be exempt so people can actually retire safely at some point. Same basic reason social security income is exempt.",
        "answer_2": "It does seem crazy that you can put your money into one account (retirement) that is legally protected against bankruptcy or collection agencies while other accounts are not. \nI believe the logic behind the law is that if the credit card companies could wipe out consumers retirement funds, there would be a lot more people on government assistance when they are too old to work.   The law that prevents credit card companies from raiding someone's retirement fund also acts as a safety net for those that get themselves in trouble with debt.\nIt does seem morally wrong that someone could declare bankruptcy and wipe out the debt that they owe while holding onto large sums of money in a retirement account, but then you consider what the lenders are doing.  \nLending companies have become more and more predatory.  In the past lenders used to focus on being paid back.   If someone had a month or two where they didn't pay, lenders would stop lending them more money and work out a payment plan to help them pay back the debt.   The opposite is true today.   If someone gets behind on payments, the credit card companies and banks salivate over the money that could be made off of this person by extending them more credit and sinking them further into debt.  Someone who is behind on their payments will have an increase in offers to take out loans or open new cards.   The days when going through bankruptcy ment you could never get approved for another credit card are gone.   Now, those who have just come through bankruptcy recieve the most advertisements to open a new credit card.   The people who can't pay their credit cards on time are the people the banks make the most money off of. \nBankruptcy & having protected accounts (retirement) seems unfair until you consider how unfair the system is to consumers.  It would be nice if they brought back the usury laws to stop the predatory lending."

However since there are two different answers (higher rates vs lower payments) we have to consider all factors.\n\nShould I put a chunk towards each, or completely pay off one of them?\n\nNo. Paying chunks toward both will not help either situation.\n\nI'd like to leave a few thousand in my savings if possible.\n\nYou cannot afford this luxury while having over $18k in credit card debt.

This way everyone gets equal footing when showing clients available houses. \nWhen someone searches for homes online or through an app like Zillow or Redfin, those sites use the data from the MLS as well. They don't actually go direct to individual Realtors to get the info; instead they have agreements with brokers who allow them access.

The payments started at 475 a month but after about 5 months the bank said they hadn't been charging her for something and the payments went up to 560 ( still a little iffy on why that is.) Anyways, she has expressed the desire to trade in for something cheaper and better on gas mileage but is worried she would have to keep paying off the jeep since she is underwater.

Unfortunately, she probably can't think about going to school until she saves up a little more.

In effect, they essentially created an enormous bet on whether house prices would continue rising -- if so, the value of those MBS increases and JPM makes money. If not, well...\nThe problem with this strategy was that they also sold additional insurance contracts against such a collapse. This means that if you combine all of the people who bought protection from JPM, they collectively owed JPM about $30B. So when house prices collapsed, JPM found itself facing over $50B in potential losses ($30B exposure + $20B in losses).

While I can't remember their exact exposure to secondary markets (derivatives, etc.), I do know some of their losses came from their investments in sub-prime mortgages and mortgage backed securities.\nWhen loans go into default, banks that hold mortgage-backed securities acquire the underlying properties as collateral. As more and more properties were defaulted on and subsequently listed by the bank attempting to recover their investment, the housing market was flooded and prices dropped. A drop in the value of the collateralizing asset increases the default risk of a loan because the sale of the property would not recover the outstanding debt. The risk of a loan is a key factor in calculating the expected present value of mortgages, and as home prices dropped the present value of the mortgage-backed securities dropped as well. "

        "question": "[INST] ELI5: What's the complete process of the milk I buy from cow to bottle? I just bought milk and it got me wondering if they're people just constantly milking millions of cows. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " \nI just bought milk and it got me wondering if they're people just constantly milking millions of cows.\n\nNo, there are a few steps between \"cow\" and \"milk on store shelves\". Here is one possible example:\n1) Cows produce milk in their udders (the mammary glands). The farmer collects this raw milk by hand or using an automated system like a bulk tanker truck. This can be done at the farm itself, where you see the animals every day, or at a larger processing plant that handles many different types of milk. In either case, the milk will need to be cooled down to around 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), which slows bacterial growth.\n2) Once collected, the milk goes through a series of tests for quality control purposes. These include checking for bacteria levels (both total bacteria counts as well as specific microorganisms such as coliforms, salmonellae, etc.), measuring pH levels (acidity), determining whether any antibiotics were used during treatment, and so forth. If any problems are found, the milk might not make it past step three.\n3) After passing all those tests, the milk gets pasteurized. Pasteurization involves heating up the liquid to kill off most harmful bacteria -- but not all of them! It also extends its shelf life by destroying some enzymes that cause spoilage. There are two common methods of doing this: High Temperature Short Time (HTST) and Low Temperature Long Time (LTLT). HTST requires temperatures above 161\u00b0F (72\u00b0C) for 15 seconds, while LTLT calls for temperatures below 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C) over several hours. Both methods result in a slightly lower nutritional content than unpasteurized milk.\n4) Now that we have safe-to-drink milk, let's talk about packaging. Some factories still use traditional glass bottles with metal caps, while others prefer plastic jugs. Milk cartons are another option. Depending on your location, some dairy products may come in boxes instead of bags. Most modern facilities utilize flexible containers made of polyethylene (plastic #1) or high density polyethylene (HDPE; plastic #2).\n5) Finally, once everything has been prepared, transported, tested, treated, and stored, the milk leaves the factory and heads out into the world. For large brands, distribution networks typically involve warehouses located near major interstates or rail lines. Smaller operations may rely more heavily on local distributors who serve smaller areas. You know how milk always seems to go sour before its expiration date? That's because the longer it takes to get to stores after leaving the manufacturer, the higher chance something happens along the way to spoil it. As a result, retailers often stock their shelves with fresh product daily.\nThere you have it!",

Usually this is a job where a farmer strokes a bull for his 'milk' almost positive there was a dirty jobs episode. \nAfter the jizz is placed in the Female cow she becomes pregnant, pregnancy/birth creates the hormones that allows lactation. \nAfter the baby cow is born their are two options, if its a girl she gets sent off to go through the same cycle as her mother. Now if its a boy this is where it gets sad, they are typically boarded up and made into veal. either way they don't get to drink the milk because its for us.\nNow after the baby cows are out of the equation a machine is used to express the milk from the teat of the cow. After this the milk is processed in two ways: homogenization which keeps the fat from separating, and pasteurization. \nPasteurization is especially key now days since most dairy cows are kept in pretty dirty conditions and the amount of fecal matter that can make its way in from dirty udders is too damn high. \nAfter all of this its placed into either a box or jug or glass bottle depending on how pretentious the milk is. \nNow Im not saying all dairy farms are like this, but honestly the demand for milk is too high for cows to be raised in green pastures.\n(Source: was in FFA, Grew up in aggie town on a farm and visited a lot of CAFOS in central California)",

If anything, we should be hearing about more delays in their next-gen Ryzen and EPYC processors, which were originally expected late last year but have been pushed back several times already.\nAMD is very likely going to report a decline in sales as well; their market share in CPUs is being eaten away by Intel and there isn't really a compelling reason to buy one over another right now unless you need something specific like a high core count server chip or a cheap gaming GPU.",

Or can it?\nFor example I bought like 800 stocks of [CFW](  when it was around $0.22 and now it is around $0.17.\nIt was around $200 so I was thinking if it went back up in like five years it could be worth selling for such a small upfront cost.\nHowever, should I sell it now or should I just wait it out?\nIs it possible for a stock to reach $0? What happens then? Do I cease to own the stock? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " A stock never goes to zero. You'll still have that number of shares even after they go bankrupt and liquidate all assets at ten cents on the dollar (or whatever). The only thing that would stop you from owning CFW is if someone else offered you more than what your shares were currently valued at.\nIf this is an American company, there are no restrictions preventing them from going above $35 per share either (although some companies may put caps into their charters), but most do not because why would they want to limit themselves?",
        "answer_1": "Welcome to the world of degenerate penny stocks.\nWhen a stock goes under a certain level, it will be delisted from major exchanges. It will then trade \"over the counter,\" and there's some other regulatory voodoo that goes on.\nIf a company goes bankrupt, it will generally wipeout the shareholders unless there is some sort of receivership that goes on. For example, lehman went bankrupt but the stock is still listed at LEHMQ.\nAs to your current position, I know it's a bit too late but you should have already had an exit plan in place... in other words you need to exit when your thesis is invalidated.\nBecause you're dealing with degenerate penny stocks, the odds of success here are extremely low.

Welcome to behavioral psych-- risk aversion, prospect theory, anchoring bias-- that's all going on between the ears right now. Focus on it, and remember it. It's not fun, and if you're going to trade, especially in degenerate penny land, you need to figure out if you like being right or if you like making money.",

This isn't because the scheme itself makes you rich; rather, it's because people join these schemes thinking they CAN get rich. They spend thousands upon thousands of dollars buying product for themselves and then selling it to other people like they were supposed to. Many people actually believe that they ARE making money -- but really what happens is that everyone else gets poorer. See point #3 below.  \n3) MLM schemes only truly benefit ONE PERSON: the CEO running the company. Anyone else in the chain loses out almost every single step along the way.

That means you're already well ahead of most people who come here asking for advice about reaching FIRE (and we love helping those people too).\nSecondly, you've got a big head start because of the inheritance money coming into play. If you were to put all of that money towards your future, you could potentially reach FI within 7 or so years instead of 15.

What percentage of your income does saving currently take up? It sounds like you might only need another ~$40k saved to hit the magic number. Then after that, continue putting away ~30% of whatever income you earn each year until you meet the 25x annual spending rule, which would probably mean around $80k more saved by the time you turn 35 assuming no growth in your career or lifestyle inflation.

Now I am stuck paying over $500 a month for a room that I cant use and know that once I can go back to work I will have lost a lot of my clientele due to the financial hardships everyone is facing. My lease goes until May 2021, there is no subletting allowed, and there is no escape clause in the contract. I reached out to the landlord requesting a reduced rent or to be allowed to break my contract. They responded that I should look into a small business loan. I have a family to support and am afraid if I take out a loan I wont be able to repay it. Do I have any other options? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " No, you don't have another option besides finding new digs by May or negotiating with your current landlord.\nYou are not obligated to continue making rent on a commercial space when you aren't using it because your business has been impacted by Covid-related economic downturns.

In the next few rounds you'll tell your landlord that you are unable to continue payments and they will most likely move towards you.\nTry to land a deal to suspend the lease for 3-6 months or work out a deal to pay a lump sum to break the lease. In the worst case, just suspend payments.\nOverall, just keep in mind that your landlord might have to feed a family himself and relies on that rent paid.",

        "question": "[INST] can someone please describe the experience of short selling a stock? Hi,\nSo, I just upgraded e*trade to a margin account, and I would like to short a stock when I feel like it will drop. So far I've been doing OK with the \"buy low, sell high\" process, and I've been selling and just waiting when stocks have been dropping recently. I'd like to be shorting and making money, since I'm pretty confident (and have been correct, so far) generally about when things will drop.  \nMaybe it's just me, but it seems scary to short a stock. Theoretically, it's just the opposite of buying long. But it seems like it's more of a gamble. Do you feel this way?  \nSo, what was your first short sell like? Do you have advice, or any \"rules of thumb\", like \"don't spend more than 50% of available cash to short a stock\", \"sell and take your losses if stock rises 20%\", etc.?   \nHow long do you typically hold before selling back? Are there any difficulties I may have? I know that if price goes UP, I'll lose money. But are there any situations where things can get out of hand real quick? I usually check my etrade every 15-30 mins.  \nTHANKS for any advice you may have!   [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You don't feel that way because you aren't actually going through the process yet. \nHere is how shorting works:\nStep 1: Borrow $X from ETrade at no interest. This is called being \"short\".\nStep 2: Buy $X worth of shares in whatever stock you want to go after.\nStep 3: Wait until the price falls below the borrow price ($X).\nStep 4: Sell all those shares at the lower price.\nStep 5: Return the original shares to ETrade.\nStep 6: Profit!\nThe reason people think shorting is risky is that Step 4 above doesn't always happen right away. Sometimes the price keeps rising instead of falling. In fact, sometimes they keep rising forever! That means that as soon as you borrow the share, the price has already gone up by X amount, which means you lost X dollars on paper immediately. Since most brokerages require you to put down some collateral while you wait for your position to unwind, you could potentially end up owing them even more money. If the stock continues to rise past your stop loss point (which you set to protect yourself), then you're stuck losing more and more money each day.\nThis risk isn't unique to shorting though - it applies to any investment decision ever made. Some days everything goes great; other days you wake up wondering why you did something stupid like buy Microsoft yesterday morning. It's important to manage your risk accordingly.",
        "answer_1": "Once again, I am posting this comment in response to people who want to short sell.  Don't do it.  If you really want to profit from a down fall in the price of a security, then purcahse a put option.  It is the same thing.  You are speculating on the movement.  When you purcahse a put option your risk of loss is strictly limited to the amount you paid for the option.  If the short moves against you (prices rises), the option loses value, but you will not lose more than your initial investment.  With a put option purchase, you will not be required to fill a margin call, and the only time your position is liquidated is if you fail to exercise or sell the option before expirary.",
        "answer_2": "If you short a stock that isn't readily traded, there is a possibility that your loan (brokerage lends you the securities to sell short) could get called in and you would be forced to cover the position (and miss out on future benefits of the stock dropping in price)\nYou will be paying dividends rather than receiving them if the stock you're short selling pays out to shareholders.\nI am sure this is different in a lot of places, but there are varying short margin requirements (depending on the price level of the stock) that could require you to secure your position with 200% cash. (ie. short $100 of ABC, margin requirement: $200 cash)\nYou are at risk for the theoretically unlimited upside to the stock, while your potential gain is only maximized if the stock drops to $0.\nAnd, again depending on liquidity of the stock, there might not be enough available to borrow to fill your order.\nDepending on the regulatory environment you are trading in, there may be sanctions in place to prevent you from shorting (European financials for example).\nIf you are going to short, you should definitely put in a stop buy order to protect your downside.\nAs mentioned, an easier way to capitalize on a bearish trend is to buy a put option. The advantages vs. short selling include:\nYour downside is limited to the size of the premium you pay. (out of the money puts are generally pretty cheap - great if you can see something like Sino Forest coming)\nYou can lever control on many more shares than you could by shorting.\nThere is no risk of your lender calling in your loan to demand delivery of shares.\nLess stringent margin requirements.\nYou can buy a put with an expiry that is decently far out (much longer than most investors would be comfortable holding a short position) giving you a better chance that whatever event/announcement/activity you think will negatively affect the share price has a chance to manifest."

        "question": "[INST] Buy and hold for life strategy Why would one want to invest and hold on to dividend paying stocks for life (as in never selling the stock)? I ask this because the yeilds for dividends  tend to be low, meaning that it would take many years for one to regain their principal back and actually start making a profit. \nFor instance if I bought a dividend distributing share with a yeild of 2% at the moment of purchase, assuming the dividend cash amount does not change significantly, would it not take 50 years for me to regain the money spent on the stock? I've always heard praises about the buy and hold strategy and how it played a large part in Warren Buffet's techniques, but 50 years to make a profit does not really seem like a great strategy. Is there a misunderstanding that I have? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You are correct that the time frame matters here. If you expect your portfolio to grow over time, then holding forever is generally a good idea as long as:\n1) The overall market grows over time\n2) Your expected return from buying and holding outweighs inflation\n3) You don't sell during down markets\n\nThe first point is pretty obvious. The second point depends entirely on what rate you expect future returns to be. Dividend payers usually do better than the S&P due to lower volatility so the third point is also important.",

",
        "answer_2": "While you are technically correct that it would take 50 years to get the money back, that\u2019s assuming both the stock price and the dividend never changes. Many dividend stocks have an annual growth of the dividend alone at about 4-8%, and on top of that, more often than not the stock price will go up over time as well. \nThat said, there are plenty of dividend paying ETFs that are perfect for long holds, like the smart beta ones who focuses on high dividend stocks that are also low-volatile, as this strategy sorts out most of the garbage.\nThose ETFs can give you 4% in yearly dividends and perform better than many other index ETFs, while at the same time is safer than stock picking.

If you only invest $100 at a time, you will likely end up with some very risky assets because your entire portfolio will consist of one single asset class. This means if said asset goes belly up, all of your money disappears. You need to make sure that each individual portion of your portfolio has a low risk profile as well as diversify across multiple classes.\nAs far as platforms for doing this...well, unfortunately they aren't out there yet.

With traditional stock brokerages, customers pay a commission fee on every trade, which would totally eliminate any profit you'd be making by only investing $100 at a time. These commissions are around 7-10$ per trade. With Robinhood, you are only charged the exchange fee, meaning the fee that the stock exchange (ex: Nasdaq) charges the broker - only a few pennies per trade, if that.

You'd have 100k in equity without making any payments, down or otherwise.\nEquity is just the residual value after taking the net of its value against what you owe.",

        "question": "[INST] Does it make sense for me to spend all of my savings on college? Something bittersweet happened: My Father passed away a few months ago, and my Mums been talking about sending money from his life insurance policy to help me go to college. She's been so depressed lately, and a few days ago she came with cookies and a letter from my dad saying a final farewell. After having a good cry together, my Mum told me to check my bank account, she sent me almost all of her roughly $97,300 for college and to help us in an emergency. She said she's not financially literate and she might waste it herself (Mum and me have lived in poverty all our lives, but I'm not that much smarter!). I was talking to my boyfriend who's a finance major, and he said this is actually not a very good thing?\nMy boyfriend said her heart was in the right place, but my Mom wasted this money by giving it to me before I graduated and it'll be drained away from the lost eligibility for financial aid. My boyfriend says I should prepay rent for my Mom, find a house with him, get a reliable car, clothes without as many holes in them etc. until down to <$20,000 because it'd be all lost without financial aid. He said that I need to wait another year to apply for aid/school, as even if I did spend most/all of it, I'd have to state on my application that I recieved it in the year which would affect my aid.  \nMy feelings say he's wrong, if the money's used for a car, house, etc. there'd still be the college loans to pay back, and no emergency fund for Mum and me along the way (especially with what's going on right now). He thinks he's right and there'd be a lot more worth for the money by spending most of it now. He felt upset that I didn't trust him and told me I'd be losing thousands by not being eligible for grants and loans that could be forgiven, but I wouldn't know because poor people usually stay poor, and anyone with financial sense would agree with him.\n\u2022 I live in the US and I'm 26 so I'd be an independent student, and it's my dream to get into the medical field and give back to the community, but I know it's almost impossible sans a degree. I live alone, and my Mom and I have no debts, but we're making little more than minimum wage and don't have much left over each month. I'd have to use this money to supplement the additional living expenses from switching to part-time so I'd have enough time to go back to school.\nI'm a long time lurker here, and after seeing some similar posts recently, I felt inspired to share my situation and talk to the kind people at r/personalfinance who're more financially adept than I am. It sounds like financial aid expects you to pay as much as you can and it probably doesn't account for your Mother giving you the costs of college, living expenses, and emergency money. It'd break her heart to know she might've messed things up, so I want to use the money in the best way possible to do right by her.\n\nGrants wouldn't save you that much, my boyfriend could be telling me to spend 80k to save >15k over the years right? I've no way of knowing how much to keep before its hurting me, or if I start spending more than I'd save in grants. What do you think the smartest way to use this money is? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Your boyfriend is correct.\nYour mother has given you nearly $100K cash. That means you will lose out on approximately $40-$50K per year in Pell Grants and other federal aid based solely on this action. You are likely looking at around $100K total in annual cost of attendance - losing that amount of aid would mean you'd owe tens of thousands every semester just to cover tuition, books, room & board. At worst case scenario, you'd essentially burn through $100K in one year.\nYou also haven't mentioned any employment income, or whether or not you have any savings beyond this windfall already. If you were to use all of these funds immediately, you'd literally have nothing saved up for whatever comes next.

As much as possible, save that money and pretend it's not there (i.e., keep working and saving as you were before). \nIn order to prevent spending all of the money on school, would you be open to considering doing 2 years at a community college? My partner went this route and probably saved about $20k.",
        "answer_2": "I think your boyfriend may have a point, by receiving that money now you may have lost eligibility to financial aid for this year. I think the suggestion to spend some of it to get your eligibility back has some merit, but don't spend it on him and don't spend on anything that you wouldn't have spent originally. That's why he said to prepay your mum's rent.\nI dont know what you can do now, but it may be good to keep looking into how you can get your eligibility for financial aid back starting next year."

        "prediction": " The phrase \"Vanguard is 'owned' by the funds\" means nothing more than \"the funds manage Vanguard.\" In other words, there is no ownership structure with stockholdings or anything like that. It simply means that Vanguard operates in the interests of its clients (i.e., the mutual funds), rather than itself as a separate entity.",
        "answer_1": "As you mentioned owners of Vanguard the company are shareholders of Vanguard funds. With most brokers, they are a publicly traded company owned by shareholders who might use the company as broker or those who don\u2019t with the only relationship with the company being via ownership of the company\u2019s shares. \nFor example, let\u2019s use Charles Schwab. They are publicly traded and have shareholders who each own a percentage of the company like any other publicly traded company. Schwab may offer funds with names like Schwab International or Schwab Tech that are products they offer. You can own any of these funds but that doesn\u2019t equal ownership in Charles Schwab the company, only their funds. Unless you actually own shares of Charles Schwab the company, you\u2019re just treating the company as a company you do business with. For example, I can use Vanguard for everything in my portfolio but also own shares of Charles Schwab the company in my Vanguard portfolio. Thus, I own both companies. If I use Schwab for my whole portfolio but don\u2019t actually hold any shares of Schwab the company then I only own whatever is in my portfolio and nothing for Charles Schwab the company.\nThe advantages of Vanguard being own by their funds/shareholders of these funds is that they don\u2019t have to focus as much on returning money back shareholders like a publicly traded company does. There is no dividend payout or pressure to grow to please shareholders. Instead their funds and the companies within those funds will take care of all that for them. Because they don\u2019t have these responsibilities, they can pass down the cost savings of no dividend payouts or having to spend money to grow to users of the Vanguard platform via low fees/expenses. If Vanguard was publicly traded like Charles Schwab then they\u2019d have to take care of costs of running the company first, then the costs of rewarding the shareholders next before doing anything for the users (not the shareholders of Schwab) of their services last.\nIt\u2019s definitely confusing and complicated and I\u2019m not even sure how big of a difference it makes realistically today but that\u2019s the best I can explain it.",

Recent college grad here who's starting a new job next week.  I'm subletting an apartment for the summer from a friend (got a great deal for an amazing place), but now I'm looking for an apartment to lease starting in August.  I work outside Atlanta in a city called Alpharetta, so there are a ton of options in the area, both in terms of price and in terms of location.\nI've been fortunate in that my parents have covered my rent while I'm in college, but this has now left me in a position where I'm a little unsure of what I should be paying for rent.  My plan was to live frugally over the next few years so that I could quickly pay off a $26,000 loan I owe my parents for my last year of college.  I made this plan with the understanding that it would likely necessitate a drop in living standard from what I've had while my parents were supporting me.\nI was aiming to spend about $600 a month on rent + $100 a month on utilities.  Here is my full budget (I made what I thought were conservative estimates, so some of the categories may be a little high):\nIncome\n\n$2300 (monthly after-tax)\n\nExpenses\n\n$600 Rent\n$100 Utilities\n$200 Groceries\n$50 Restaurants\n$200 Auto Insurance\n$20 Highway Toll\n$200 Gas\n$215 Loan Payment\n$50 Entertainment\n$30 Haircut\n$25 Miscellaneous\n$8 Hulu Plus\n\nLeft Over\n\n$602\n\nBasically my plan was to take that extra $602 a month an throw it at my loan so that I could be done with it as soon as possible.  I talked to my parents today though, and they said that I shouldn't constrict myself too much - that if I was able to find a better apartment in a better location I should consider spending an extra hundred or two a month; that I shouldn't kill myself to be too frugal.  Keep in mind that my parents are the epitome of frugal - they have literally no debt, pay cash for their cars, coupon, etc.\nNow I will admit that there is a big difference between a $600 a month apartment in Atlanta and an $800 a month apartment.  For $800 I could live in a gated community with a pool and tennis courts in a good location like the Virginia Highlands or Buckhead.  For $600 a month I'm going to have to look for something less fancy, in a less desirable and potentially less safe location.\nI was willing to make a little bit of a sacrifice in terms of my living accommodations in order to get my financial house in order, but now my parents have thrown me for a loop.

I\u2019m thinking my house probably looks like something is wrong with it due to it being on the market so long.   I guess I\u2019ll hold on to it for another year or so and try again. \nThanks for reading this novel and for all the advice :)\nOriginal post:\nSo as stated, I can\u2019t sell my house.  The house was built in 2011. I bought it dec 2014 for 255k.  I am in the Central Valley of California.  My house is part of a planned community that was half built when I bought my house.  The houses built after I bought my house are roughly 1000 square foot larger and cost about 100k more.  The house has granite, wood floors, new carpet (2017) and has been painted with a fresh coat of paint.  It is in a gated complex with access to a pool, water park and playground.\nI am getting married in 26 days and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s house is a bit bigger and better equipped for a growing family.  We listed my house 2 months ago for 279,900. Right off the bat we got an offer for 274,000. We talked them up to 275,000 and accepted the offer. Two days later they\u2019ve backed out, saying they were going with new construction instead. We have had 8 offers on the house and have accepted 6.  All of the buyers backed out within 24 hours. Some have given reasons for backing out such as they found out they were relocating the next day or They found out their interest rates would be 8%.\nThis past Saturday we accepted an all cash offer of 267 and said she could close in 12 days.  This woman had previously offered 240 and we told her no. We accepted the offer of 267 on Saturday. Sunday morning, our realtor called us and said the woman backed out because she was driving Through the neighbor hood and saw a do not dig sign placed there because of a high pressure gas line. Apparently this freaked her out and she backed out.  We lowered our asking price to 269,900, but I\u2019m not sure that was the right thing to do since we have had no trouble getting offers at the higher price.\nWe are not in financial trouble and can afford to make mortgage payments on both houses, but would obviously rather only have one house. We have considered renting but due to the strict hoa rules have decided that it\u2019s not a great option with this house.\nDoes anyone know what the issue is here?  Any advice?  Do we need a new realtor?\nThank you so much for reading this! [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Your realtor needs to tell you why your home isn't selling.\nYou did nothing wrong by accepting a higher offer; the buyer did everything wrong by backing out over something completely irrelevant to the property itself. You should take this opportunity to fire your listing agent immediately and find someone else to help you move forward.",
        "answer_1": "This was probably mentioned in response to your original post, but buyers should not be surprised by the size of their payments/interest rates. They should be submitting a pre-approval letter for their loan along with their offer. In getting that letter they should be made aware of an estimated monthly payment. ",
        "answer_2": "Maybe your listing agent didn't do a good job. How was the open house? Did the photos look good? I know you had many offers, but presentation makes a lasting impact on buyers - speaking from experience as a buyer myself. Maybe when you try again, hire the agent who listed that other house."

        "question": "[INST] Homeowners: What's Your Mortgage to Income Ratio? Would You Share Advice? If you're a homeowner, you can calculate your mortgage:income ratio (sometimes called a front-end ratio) by dividing your monthly mortgage costs (usually including associated costs like homeowner's insurance, property tax and mortgage insurance) by your pretax monthly salary.\nFor example, if you earn $10,000 per month ($120,000 per year salary) and you pay $2,000 per month in mortgage costs and related fees, your mortgage:income ratio is 0.20.\n0.20 = 2,000 / 10,000\n\nLenders recommend that this number not go above 0.28, but we at Personal Finance know that this number should be as low as you can make it while meeting your housing requirements. So I'd love to hear from folks who own their homes:\n\nWhat is your mortgage:income ratio? What was it when you bought your house?\nWhat area do you live in? (or: do you live in a low or high cost-of-living area?)\nDoes your mortgage feel too high?

Alright, with that out of the way, :rubs hands together: here we go. \nMy husband worked for a big corporation in for a couple of years. His employment ended in 2012 when we moved to a different city. He had stock in the company as part of his benefits, but did nothing with them, so far as I know, when he left.

This letter claimed that my husband and I had earned income that we hadn't claimed in 2014. From what I can tell from the itemized list, this is money is from the stocks that he had while at that company, for a total of about $8,000.

Or even cashed a check that we might have gotten at our old address? If so, how do we go about fraud claims (or whatever it is we need to do).\n\n\nCan we defer paying the IRS till this all gets sorted out \u2014 without having to pay the interest?

I live with my parents and my younger brother who is still in college. He is 23. We also live in NJ is that makes a difference \nNow for the details:\nMy fathers SS pays \\~ $2000 monthly which does not even cover the house mortgage. Thats all the income my parents have. They used to file taxes jointly.\nI cover everything else including all the food, house hold bills, their credit card debt, car insurance, etc. Now this year I began working an entry level  engineering position in Pharma making \\~ 60k.

        "prediction": " No, you cannot claim them as your dependents. Your father works (albeit very little), he files his own tax returns, and if there were any dependency exemptions available they would go to him since he supports himself first.",
        "answer_1": "I would look into filing as head of household, rather than single, with your parents and sibling as qualified dependents. It allows for a high standard deduction and lower tax rate.\nTo qualify as dependents, there is a certain earned income level threshold that they cannot reach, but I do not believe SS counts against that threshold.",
        "answer_2": "Since you work in Pharma, can you quietly meet with the head of sales and ask about the possibility of becoming a sales rep? Successful sales reps in the pharma industry can make approximately twice what you make. But you will need to confirm that in your company."

        "question": "[INST] Why invest in the S&P 500? Hi. I\u2019m 18 and relatively new to investing in the stock market (started in November). I initially put in ~$430 to my Robinhood account, which I\u2019ve grown to ~$500 based on what I\u2019ve learned through reading articles/books and watching a lot of YouTube. Since I\u2019ve begun, I\u2019ve only invested in \u201cbig name\u201d stocks (CGC, AAPL, TSLA, etc). \nEverywhere I look, I always see how the S&P 500 has succeeded immensely in the last 20 years, with most traders being unable to beat it. A lot of people continue to say that the S&P is the safest bet with regards to long term investing. I have about 3k saved up and was considering putting 1.5-2k in ETFs like SPY or VOO while keeping the $500 I already have in Robinhood to play around with other actual stocks. I guess this leads me to my questions:\nWould it be smart to throw such a large portion of my money into S&P 500 ETFs?\nWhy is there so much hype surrounding it?\nAre there any bear cases for it?\nI realize I can find a lot of this info online, but I want to see a lot of individual takes on this since I\u2019m just getting into the game. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Because you're asking why do millions of investors choose to invest their life savings in something...\nThe answer is because they know that over time, the market as a whole will outperform almost anything else by a wide margin. The average return of the US Stock Market since its inception is approximately 9% per year after inflation; nobody knows exactly where the market will go tomorrow, next week, next month - but over many decades, history says that it will trend higher more often than lower. Investors who recognize this and decide to ride this wave are called \"buy & hold\" investors.\nTherefore, if your goal is simply to grow your wealth at an above-average rate without taking excessive risk, then yes, throwing all your money into index funds tracking the S&P 500 makes perfect sense. It's not a guarantee of success, but it gives you a better chance than almost every other strategy.",
        "answer_1": "Because if you buy stocks on your own, the high liklihood is that you may do well initially, but eventually you'll get in something that doesn't do well and you'll not want to sell because then you'd be \"losing money\".  Over time, this causes your returns to be much lower, and more stressful, than simply putting the money into an S&P 500 fund and forgetting about it.",

        "question": "[INST] High Yield Dividends Can anyone offer some advice about high yield dividend stocks.  Is there anything specific I should look for when investing in these types of stock. [/INST]",
        "prediction": "\nIs there anything specific I should look for when investing in these types of stock.\n\nYes, yes there is:\n1) Don't buy them!\nSeriously though...\n2) The higher the yield, the more likely you are to lose your shirt on it. You want a high return from a low risk asset (stock), not vice versa. A company that pays out $5 per share in annual dividends and has a PE ratio of 30 probably doesn't have much growth potential left; if they did, they wouldn't be paying so much cash back to shareholders instead of reinvesting profits into growing their business.\n3) Look at the payout ratio. If a company is paying out more than half its earnings as dividends every year, then you can reasonably expect those dividends to get cut eventually or else the company will go bankrupt soon afterward. It'd be better to take a smaller percentage of earnings now but with room to grow later rather than relying on an unsustainable model forevermore.\n4) Compare the dividend yield against other similar companies in the industry. For example, if the S&P 500 averages around 2% in yields right now, does this particular stock really deserve a premium? Maybe so - maybe it's got a great balance sheet, strong management team, etc., which could justify the extra return over what others in the same space are offering. But generally speaking, a higher-yielding stock is going to mean lower expected returns down the line since the market already priced in all the good stuff earlier.",
        "answer_1": "Look at earnings.  If dividends are too high and earnings too low, you gotta figure that the company is enticing you to buy the stock based on dividend yield and to ignore the fundamentals of the company.",

Both of my jobs are serving/bartending so I make a really good money and was able to pay off my debt within a couple months of really cracking down.

The paint job here appears to include blending in new paint with what you already had on your car ($350 + $125 = $475), which seems reasonable if it's a small enough repair. If they are replacing more body panel(s) than just the front bumper, then yes, this number should be lower.\n3) Frame damage (no cost listed). It sounds like the frame isn't bent or twisted, so there shouldn't be any frame work involved, unless your shop wants to charge you for the inspection process.\nThe total comes out to $1101, and this doesn't even touch on possible interior repairs (dashboard replacement, door panels, etc.) Insurance companies will usually pay out based on the actual cash value (ACV) of the vehicle, rather than its book value. That means the insurer won't pay more than the car was worth when the accident happened. So, let's look at some numbers from KBB.com:\n[2009 Toyota Camry LE](  \n$12K - $20K - $12K = $8K\nThis suggests that your car was probably worth around $8k at the moment of the crash. A quick check shows that the NADA Guides put the ACV for a 2009 Toyota Camry LE in excellent condition at about $8,100-$9,100. Since the estimates don't mention any significant interior repairs, we can assume that this is roughly accurate.\nTherefore, you could argue that the estimate is too high because it exceeds the current market value of your car by quite a bit. However, keep in mind that if the estimate does reflect the true amount needed to get your car back on the road safely, then you still need to spend money to fix your car, regardless of whether or not you think the estimate is fair.",

At 31, she's been with the Dept. of Ed. for 9 years, and if she retires at about 60 (38 years service time), she'll have a little more then 70% of her salary paid out to her until she dies. Let me say outright how bloody fortunate we are. Well aware, and humbled.\nI make in the neighborhood of $30k as your friendly neighborhood security guard, and together we have about $7k a month in take-home pay (after 10% goes to our retirement plans), of which about $4k is gobbled by fixed and semi-fixed expenses, notably a $2200 mortgage with $620/mo maintenance fee (it's Brooklyn.) That leaves $3k. (We also have a 1 year old child.)\nEverything I've read on this lovely, lovely sub stresses heavy retirement savings, which has been enlightening. But it seems like we'll be well set for retirement, especially when our mortgage is paid off when we're both 61 (hopefully.) So I'm kind of not sure what to do with my savings.\nWe have the kid, so I wonder if I should forego IRA contributions and instead plow the money into a 529? Other things I've thought of doing are paying off our modest car loan and our modest student loans, or maybe even throwing money at our mortgage to pay down the principal (4.5% interest)?

I plan on insuring both our lives but haven't gotten there quick yet. All of this is a process -- thanks PF! 4. I believe in generally living modestly instead of precise budgeting, so though I understand where you're coming from if you think it's folly, I don't want my \"big ticket fund\" weighted toward particular goals. I have a small kid, might have another, and truly don't know what to expect out of life.\nMany thanks for your help, peeps.

        "prediction": "\nSo I'm kind of not sure what to do with my savings.\n\nThat's the million dollar question. You shouldn't change anything based solely on the fact that you get a nice pension. This doesn't mean you aren't saving aggressively; it just means that your emergency fund and retirement accounts are now going to focus less on maximizing returns and more on providing liquidity while minimizing risk.\nThe first step is to determine whether the pension allows you to fully max out your tax-advantaged retirement accounts each year ($24K pretax + $6K catchup). If yes, you need to fill all available space in these accounts before considering any non-retirement savings. Once you reach that point, you can consider opening a 529 and focusing some additional savings towards the mortgage and debts.\nOnce you eliminate all taxable savings options, the next item of business is figuring out how much you want to save outside of tax advantaged accounts. Do you want to throw extra cash at the mortgage, give yourself a bigger Big Ticket Fund, open a brokerage account, contribute to college savings, start an HSA...or something else entirely?\nFinally, if you are confident that you won't touch your nest egg during retirement, you may choose to stop contributing to traditional retirement accounts altogether after hitting the maximum. However, since you have indicated that you would probably continue making regular contributions anyway, that isn't really relevant to you right now.",

        "question": "[INST] When would I buy a mutual fund vs. the equivalent ETF? Is one almost always better than the other? I'm looking to start investing and am confused on if I should be doing ETFs or just open an account with a mutual fund.  Guidance would be appreciated! [/INST]",
        "prediction": " There is no \"almost always\" here, but:\nETF = Mutual Fund in this case.\nMutual funds are nothing more than an index of stocks (or bonds) that you can buy shares into. They have expenses like any other investment vehicle - management fees, administrative costs, etc. So when comparing two similar investments, it makes sense to choose the lower-cost option. In general, most people agree that the best way to get access to your money is through low-expense index funds / ETFs rather than actively managed ones.\nThe main advantage of mutual funds over ETFs is that they offer a wide range of types of mutual funds that aren't available as ETFs. This includes things like real estate, commodities, private equity, hedge funds, international investments, sector funds, etc. These specialized funds may not make much sense for someone who doesn't need them, so go ahead and use whatever gives you the lowest overall cost.",
        "answer_1": "One disadvantage of ETFs is that you can only buy whole shares. If you have $1000 to invest and you're buying shares that cost $101 you'll buy 9 shares and have $91 left over. A mutual fund with the same share price would allow you to buy 9.901 shares.\nETFs generally have a lower expense ratio and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at a variable price whereas traditional mutual funds have a single updated price at the end of every day (NAV = net asset value).\nThey both have advantages and disadvantages so it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish and which financial institution you're working with.",
        "answer_2": "You've gotten good advice here.  I'll just add that it may also depend on how much you have to invest and when.  \nIf you can invest $500/month minimum, then ETFs are probably fine.  You can generally buy a number of shares that is roughly equivalent to that amount.  Obviously, the more you invest monthly the easier it is to get close to an exact amount, but it will always be off by a little.  For a long time, I did a combo of VTI, VXUS and BND that I could get to pretty close to $1000/month when that was my investment budget.\nOn the other hand, if you just want to do a set amount each month without worrying about it, you can do the mutual funds with fixed amounts very easily."

        "answer_1": "As a rule of thumb, your monthly rent should be about 1% of your purchase price in order to cover all of your expenses and make decent cash flow.  So like if you buy a house for $300k you should be able to rent it out for $3000/mo.\nHowever I think that you will find that in areas with a strong housing market you'll get something like 50-60% of that, i.e. $1500-1700/mo.  If you run the numbers and include all costs, property tax, insurance, vacancy, marketing expenses, repair and upkeep, you'll probably be basically breaking even on a cash flow basis.  So the only way you will make money is through appreciation and paying down your mortgage.  You will make a little bit this way but if you consider your down payment tied up in the house it might not be a very good return on investment.  It would all depend on the appreciation.\nManaging a rental property when you don't live in the area is difficult because you can't go see the property and have to depend 100% on people that you hire to go out there.  If you hire a company to take care of everything, expect to pay about 8-10% of the rent to them as a fee.  This further cuts into your cash flows and if the company doesn't do a great job it can lead to additional expenses.\nOverall I'd take a very realistic look at the numbers and make sure it is worthwhile.

All the good stuff you listed shouldn't be traded, unless you see it's about to break down in a way you can't prevent.\nPick up a side hustle.  It's so common to fill our lives with the \"work schedule\" that allots no time to your personal growth, except for maybe on the weekends, which isn't enough to get drilled into something.  \"Personal growth\" being the key phrase here, find something that's in the neighborhood of something you already enjoy, that you want to get better at.  Example: tool-making, wood carving, jewelry-making.  Reserve enough time outside of work hours to make a little progress every day.  Aim to start a business selling your widgets, and gain profits from your passion.   If it starts to pick up, you may negotiate taking Tuesdays off or something to allow you more freedom in growing this pursuit.  \nAnother thing to consider is purchasing a percentage of the business.  If you have good enough savings or credit to invest in the company, such as to have a reasonable percentage of ownership, then you are effectively a partner.  As part owner, you should be able to bring up a vote to increase your own salary by a percentage at the next shareholder meeting.  If you buy a controlling stake, no votes are necessary.  \nI know two insurance salesmen.  One was working at the local Tea store for extra cash, then within a few years, bought the franchise location and only pokes his head in every two weeks or so.  The other has a huge grill and makes plastic-wrapped barbecue plates by the dozens and sells them to local businesses.  I think he even spends his lunch-break delivering them to offices around town.  \nIt's totally feasible to get a dirt cheap website set up showcasing some of your.... personalized hammers or what-have-you, and make web-sales, shipping on the weekends, of things that you made in your productive hobby-time.  You'll have a reliable income stream set up from something that used to just be TV time. "

        "question": "[INST] Affording the Nursing Home In search of financial/legal advice. Here's the situation.\n&x200B\nThe state is Minnesota. Grandmother (85) and Grandfather (86) have lived together with my Mother for the past 5+ years. Grandmother and Grandfather own their own home and are listed together on the deed. Grandmother + Grandfather have income from Social Security + pension totaling around $6,000 per month. We aren't certain about bank balance, investments, and other liquid assets.\n&x200B\nGrandmother has developed Alzheimer's/dementia. Disease has progressively grown worse to the point of being unmanagable. Situation is causing tremendous hardship/stress. The family has hired a care worker to visit on weekdays and attend to Grandmother's needs, but even so it's increasingly untenable. There are safety issues with Grandmother being unattended, and there is a constant paranoia that she might wander out of the home in the middle of the night. She basically requires constant supervision and that isn't something we're equipped to provide. We need to get her into a nursing home.\n&x200B\nCheapest nearby nursing home is $5,000 per month. Some as high as $8,000. My understanding is Medicare won't pay, Medicaid would but they would need to declare bankruptcy to qualify.\n&x200B\nQuestion is, what is the best way to get Grandmother into a nursing home with minimum out-of-pocket whilst also protecting the house from being taken away from them? Are there state/federal programs we should be aware of? What are our options?\n&x200B\nThanks. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You can't afford this right now: you don't know how much money your grandparents have, which means you cannot determine whether or not they will qualify for Medicaid assistance. Without that information, it sounds like you'd be putting all of their savings at risk by moving them into a facility.\nYou really need to sit down with an elder law attorney who specializes in long term care planning ASAP.",
        "answer_1": "I am a home health social worker. \nFor starters, get Grandma & Grandpa both on Medicaid. Different states have different rules about Medicaid. If they have any savings accounts, they will need to spend that money. Do NOT let them write you (or anyone else) a big check for thousands of dollars as a way of getting rid of it, it can mess up the Medicaid process and complicate it. \nIf the house is paid for, they might consider a reverse mortgage which means that the bank buys their house and makes payments to them for several years. This can also complicate the Medicaid process, so just be careful and try to get with an attorney who knows all the ins and outs of your state's Medicaid rules. \nSome nursing homes will take Grandma now if they know for sure that she will be approved for Medicaid. You'd have to call around and ask; usually there's at least one in each town that does that. \nSpeaking of nursing homes, the kind that you really want to put Grandma in is one with a memory care unit. This is a locked-door facility. Staff and visitors can come and go, but the patients stay and are entertained and fed and cared for all in the same place; they aren't allowed to wander. \nAlso, when picking a nursing home, show up unannounced for a visit. Don't call and ask them what their hours are or visiting policy or tip them off in any way that you are coming. Just show up. You don't want them to have time to make the place look nice just for your visit. \nAnd finally, these may be harder to find, but there are nursing homes in the community that look like regular everyday homes. They may not even have a sign out front. These places can be hit or miss. Some are fantastic and some I wouldn't send my worst enemy to, but by and large, their prices are actually pretty reasonable, usually in the $2-3K range. They may be listed in the phone book, or you can sometimes ask around, sometimes nurses know about them by word of mouth.",
        "answer_2": "There are a lot of provisions set forth for Medicaid to not take assets away from a community living based spouse.  Talk to an adult case worker or area agency on aging represenative.  They can help with assessing your grandmother to get her admitted to a facility and discuss the financial costs of doing so.\nIf your grandparents have savings/cincome wise and in general everything is split down the middle and everything on the side of grandma will go to pay for her cost of care.  Medicaid has a 5 year look back at all financial transactions and a case worker would be looking at bank statements, retirement accounts, stocks, etc.  Any asset.   Primary residences are normally excluded from asset checks as long as a spouse is using it as a primary residence.  Some income is also excluded from her side, for the spouse to live off of.  If there are a lot of complex accounts that your grandparents have it might be good to utilize an elder law attorney to do an application that will protect as much as possible for your grandfather's benefit.  If there is little to no savings less, then just go talk to a nursing home and work with them to put in an application with the state.  Most facilities i've worked at will help you organize the application and submit it themselves, so they actually get paid.   After everything is calculated, granddad will just pay whatever amounts decided upon out of savings and then eventually just a part of the monthly income (and then the facility bills the rest to the state for reimbursement).  Applications can take a while to approve for the state, but as long as everyone is helping with the process most facilities have no issue staying in a Medicaid pending status.\n&x200B\nIf there are any questionable gifts of large sums of money in the past 5 years (maybe longer in some states) that may make eligibility impossible."

The two should always match exactly, but sometimes people confuse them because they are related concepts.\nSince I selected 1 reinvestments...\nYes.

You're doing great considering where you came from.\nSecond: your situation sounds exactly like what this subreddit is here to help with.\nYou need two things:\n\nA budget. Sit down right now and figure out how much money is coming in each month ($5K). How much goes towards bills ($4K)? Food? Gas? Savings? Day care? Entertainment? Your answer will tell us if you're living within your means.\nAn emergency fund. Do NOT spend another penny until you have three months expenses set aside as an absolute minimum. This needs to be fully liquid - cash in a safe, in a mattress, buried somewhere outside, etc. If anything unexpected happens tomorrow, you want to make sure you still have enough money to cover everything while you sort yourself out.\n\nOnce those two steps are done, then you can start looking at \"how should I invest?\"",

Your employer may offer a benefits package that includes insurance, but it is seldomly enough. You will want enough life to cover final expenses, debts, mortgage, and provide enough $$ for your family for the years of hardship that follow losing the head of household. Luckily you are still young, so your premiums (cost of insurance) should be inexpensive. Disability benefits should be about 60% of your income. You could invest every spare penny yo u have and still never come close to the wealth you can create for your family with a decent term life policy, which at 30 years of age will probably cost less than your car insurance."

        "question": "[INST] Drowning in Student Loan debt I'm just gonna put it out there, I have $186,207.12 in unsubsidized student loans at a fixed interest rate of 8%\nThe minimum payment is $2,395.21 each month which my parents have been very generously barely been scraping by the pay but they're 59 & 58 respectively and on the verge of retiring they can't finically afford to keep paying this loan that they realistically should have never taken out for me (parents CRUSH YOUR CHILDREN'S DREAMS TELL THEM NO WE CANT AFFORD THIS). I recently paid off the student loans that were directly in my name after 2 years and now I'm going to contribute to paying off that mountain.\nRight now my budget looks like this\nIncome $3960 per month (this is after taxes and assuming I don't work over time which I do at least 2 times a month)\nRent $899\nPhone $142 (it will be going down to $60 come Nov)\nInternet $20\nElectric $30\nHulu $8\nSaving $600\nAdobe CC $54 (I need this for work which makes me wonder if I can write it off on my taxes?)\nTransportation $116\nThat if my math is right means I have $2200~ left at the end of the month with some wobble room for food (which I left out because month to month what I spend on food widely varies) which just barely covers the minimum payment on the loans which based on my math means it would take me 9 years to pay them off and I would pay $74,521.93 in interest in that time which is crazy! Right now theres a balance of $488.13 in owed interest that I've set a payment for friday to pay off on top of the already scheduled required payment. \nSo I have two questions is there any feasible way for me to get a loan of equal value at a lower interest rate? And is there any other suggestion about what I could be doing to proactively tackle this loan? \nI guess I should add too every 6 months or so I get a raise, or a pay upgrade I don't know how to properly explain, I work freelance and every new job I take is a little more complex at a higher skill set so I usually negotiate a higher salary. In the last year I've gotten a $14/hr pay increase and thats on trend to continue so its foreseeable that I could pay more at a future point.  [/INST]",

But if you did, you could put roughly $950 more per month toward the loan.  You should also stop trying to save when you're drowning in debt.  You said your emergency fund is good to go.  Start putting that $600 towards the debt instead.\nWith an extra $1,550 going towards the loan, it will be paid off somewhere in the middle of 2020.  Less than five years.  If you work more overtime and get pay increases, it could be less than that.\nImagine the loan being gone.  Completely paid off.  You can move forward with your life and not be a burden to yourself or your parents.

Student loans suck for a variety of reasons. you need to educate yourself about student loans before you will really be in a position to come up with a workable plan.  I have found Heather Jarvis' site to be very helpful:  \nIt is possible to refi your loans to obtain both a better interest rate and a lower monthly payment. Of course one of the other factors is that this involves amortizing your loans over a longer period. Which means you will pay more in the long run and it will take longer to pay off the loans. This also means going from federal to private loans which reduces the payment deferral options available to you. But if the current payment plan just isn't working then you have to change something. \nI did a quick back of the envelope calculation of 185k principle at 8% with a 10 year amortization. The monthly payment amount I am calculating is around $2200 per month. So your parents' current loans do not appear to be on any sort of income based repayment plan. \nWhen you are ready to refi you will want to shop the loans around a bit.

Here's my checklist:\n\nA solid emergency fund including mortgage and other housing costs.\nNo high interest rate debts.\nAble to continue saving 15% or more for retirement.\nA 20% down payment to avoid PMI and prove that you can actually afford it.  (How are you going to be able to afford a house if you can't even scrape together a good down payment before taking on all of those costs?)\nA good credit score and a decent mortgage rate (relative to current mortgage market).\nEnough income to pay mortgage and other costs.  If you plan on becoming a single-income household in the future, this must be considered before you buy a house.\nNo intention to move for at least 5 years.\nEnough time to maintain and care for a home.\nAbility to find an affordable place close enough to work.

Nobody here is going to get on you or anyone else for doing that. Good job on paying down your debts, definitely build up your emergency fund, and if you choose to invest do so through Vanguard/Schwab/Fidelity, not through an ELP (loads or expense ratios of over about 0.50% are blatant highway robbery and should not be supported)."

I've tried repeatedly to get it straightened out. \nIn January (2015), Citi went back to my lawyer and said it had mistakenly \"destroyed\" the DIL and asked if I would agree to an uncontested foreclosure.

The chore chart will be based on their abilities and ages. Each day, they have chores to complete, and at the end of the week if they have completed all of their chores, they receive their allowance. \n2.) Allowance can be age-based, but doesn't have to be. For example, I wouldn't feel the need to give a 5 year old $5 weekly. They would be content with a dollar. \n3.) Each child should have a savings account. When they get their weekly allowance, double it. They put the double into their savings account. \n4.) Teach them about the \"Parent Credit Plan\". This is a fake credit card system. They can borrow money from you, but they have to pay it back within x amount of time. If they're late, that's okay, but they either have to pay a late fee, or do an extra chore. \n5.) Once they are old enough to work, they should be. It's important to work in retail for many reasons, but one key reason is learning about money. Encourage them to continue to contribute to their savings account. Have them set up a checking account with direct deposit, and teach them to set up an automatic transfer to savings. \n6.)

I don't think that is the best idea. Give them the allowance, tell them what their allowance covers, and be strong to not give them extra money for those things included in the allowance. My parents would sometimes give me an advance on the next week's allowance when it got close to the next \"pay period,\" but I think they should have skimmed %5 off the top like a payday advance might.\nHow old are they? What age do you want to start the money lessons?"

If you've withheld more throughout the year than you owe  when you file, you get a refund.

Hi personalfinance!\nI am soon to be wed to the love of my life :) However, I am a graduating college senior, and beyond working hard and budgeting for food and simple bills like gasoline, I'm relatively new to managing money as an adult, much less an adult with a wife to care for. \nSo, I'm here for general advice about managing money/buying health insurance/saving for a car for her/college debt management/etc. Anything anyone can think of that would be good for a newly-wed couple to know about healthy management of our money.\nA little info about me: I work at a pizza place, delivering pizzas. The pay is minimum wage + tips. I can easily make $10-$15 an hour though, with the tips. That is going to change here soon, and I will be moving to another state to intern, and once we are married, she will join me. The internship is unpaid until I get my school credit, and then I will transition into a paid internship with the intent of full-time hiring. (It's a good deal, I've been told by my college adviser. Not many interns get offered paid positions with consideration for being hired, apparently. It is a live sound company, and I will work as an audio engineering assistant, if that is relevant.) I am about to graduate with a B.S. in Audio Engineering and Producing.

I've been wanting to write this for awhile and figured with the recent market turmoil and people social distancing (redditing), now might be a good time to reach some open minds.\nReal Estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion in this sub so please consider if this isn't for you, it doesn't mean it's not helpful to someone. This post is for anyone that is willing to consider real estate as part of their portfolio.\nI'm talking about holding physical real estate with a bank loan or mortgage.

I went from living in a shared 2-bedroom apartment to a one-bedroom apartment, and am saving an extra $1296 per month doing it. How so? I invested $62k and bought a multi-family home, living in one unit and renting out the other 3. Don't have $62k for a down payment? You probably qualify for a FHA loan for 3.5% down.

In this real estate focused post, that could mean renting out and extra room or garage.\nWhile I love my VTSAX for it's simplicity and returns, I expect this investment will have 2-4x the returns of VTSAX and add diversification to my portfolio.

        "prediction": " \"real estate investment is always downvoted to oblivion\"\nIt gets downvoted because:\n\nThe vast majority of people who try to buy rental property fail.\nThose who do succeed are typically those who had a significant amount of money to begin with already.

Your post, unfortunately, isn't much of an exception. Anyone saying that ANY investment will have 2x4x the returns of VTSAX over the long term is selling snake oil.\nBut also some of the monthly numbers fall into the same traps that I see over an over again:\n\nThey compare leveraged RE numbers versus unleveraged equity numbers.\nThey don't include time costs\nThey either don't include maintenance costs or vastly underestimate them.\nThe don't include risks of evictions, non-payment, and vacancies. (This is one of the things that worries me the most. People who cannot pay the mortgage without the rental income are people who will get into serious trouble sooner or later.)\nThey make very optimistic assumptions about rental income rates. It varies market to market, but most rental rates aren't going to cover mortage+tax+insurance, let alone mortgage+tax+insurance+maintenance+transaction costs+capital costs. Active real estate investment is a generally a long game where your eventual profit comes via capital gains and rent increases.\n\nAgain, let me be 100% clear, I am not against real estate investing. I just think that it is often portrayed with very rose colored glasses on investment boards. Sure, if you can find an excellent property, with excellent tenants, and excellent appreciation you will make out great.

Currently she is living at home and is making about 60k a year but has to commute from 1 hour to 1 and a half hours.

I recently lost my job (and therefore my dental insurance), so when I got a text from my dentist saying that I had an appointment upcoming I called and cancelled a week in advance.  My appointment was supposed to be on the 22nd and I called on the 15th.  They didn't mention any cancellation fees while I was on the phone, but a few days ago a bill for $450 showed up in my mailbox.  I initially thought that they didn't actually cancel it and counted me as a no-show, but the date on the bill is the 15th, when I called.   I don't have a recording of the call, so the only record I have is the message that reminded me of the appointment and the timestamp of the call.  I don't have the money to pay this and frankly I don't feel like I should have to.  Has anyone had to deal with a similar situation before? \nI'm going to call them tomorrow and see what's up? But until then I'm stressing out pretty bad about paying this.\nEdit: What are my options if they won't negotiate? Can I refuse to pay?\nUpdate:  Though the bill is labelled as \"missed appointment\" it was actually for some work that was done back in January that insurance didn't fully cover.  It's still a surprise, but at least it's for services received. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " First off - you did not miss your appointment. You told them you were not coming. \nIf their policy is to charge a fee for missed appointments, there needs to be something in writing stating such somewhere (a letter or email) informing you of said policy. If nothing exists, they cannot legally charge you for missing an appointment. \nCall them again, explain that you specifically asked to cancel the appointment, and ask why they charged you anyway.",
        "answer_1": "For the record, $450 sounds absolutely insane. My check-ups that I actually attend cost half that. \nIf they put their foot down, report them to the BBB for sure. $450 with no service performed is absurd.",
        "answer_2": "My wife is rather forgetful about appointments, and out dentist will charge a rescheduling fee for a missed appointment, but that's $25. I'd not make any assumptions and call to verify the bill and the related charges, it could be a mistake, perhaps they were processing the bill for another client when you called in to cancel, and they got something crossed up in the billing system."

        "question": "[INST] I work for the government and have to pay into a mandatory pension plan, but I don't know if I'm going to work for the government forever. Should I start my own retirement fund? Basically, I contribute a large amount of my paycheck to a pension plan which I cannot opt out of (around 15% every two weeks). If I stay with the government for 35 years or so, I'll get a pretty decent pension at around 80% of my income until I die.\nBut I'm also 28 right now, and I have no idea if I want to work for the government for the rest of my life. But I've been working for them since I was 25 and have no real retirement savings of my own, so I don't really know what to do if I leave. I have quite a bit of money contributed to my pension plan already.\nSo I guess my question is, should I start my own RRSP or TSFA? (I'm in Canada).

        "prediction": " Yes you should be contributing your own retirement funds regardless.\nIt sounds like your situation meets the criteria for \"defined benefit\" plans: You are guaranteed an income stream from your employer upon retiring; whether that income stream exceeds your contributions depends on how well they manage their investments.\nIn this case it makes sense not to touch those funds unless absolutely necessary because any withdrawals before age 60 will likely result in penalties as well as lowering your eventual payout when you actually take advantage of the guarantee.",

I also should add that I\u2019m looking for jobs and can\u2019t see myself staying 10+ years (barely get cost of living raises, definitely no room for advancement or salary growth)\nMy issue is that the fund is super shaky, and is only funded to cover 30% of its projected obligations.

I currently own a house and owe approximately $150,000. My interest rate is 4.0%. There\u2019s about 25 years left on the loan. My house is currently estimated to be worth about $350,000. I also have a home equity line of credit used for improvements at about $60,000.

Or put the money in savings and use it as cash plus the equity in the sale? Thanks! [/INST]",
        "prediction": " If you're going to buy another house within 5 years:\nPut money into savings.\nThe reason why is that your expected return from investing the money by putting it in savings will probably exceed any benefit you get from reducing your mortgage balance before buying again.",

        "answer_2": "Depends on the order of the transaction. Do you plan to sell first, then go house hunting, or do you plan to buy first, and then sell the old one?\nIf you plan to take the \"sell first, then house hunt\" route, then you'll want that guaranteed 4% rate of pumping money into your home to boost your equity later during the sale.\nIf you plan to take the \"buy first, then sell\" route, you'll want to be cash heavy. The equity in your current home is useless in the initial purchase (although it can be great for a subsequent refi). I would save it in a high-yield savings account, or possibly in CDs (with maturity planned for when you'll start house hunting).\nA five year time horizon puts a lot of risk on an investment - it's not long enough to ensure that it doesn't temporarily lose significant value by the time you need it. I do think that, any longer, and that risk drops off quickly, but five is about the ceiling of what I would consider to be a \"short term investment\"."

Is there anything that can be done to avoid this? I just found out my parents are due to inherit a lot of debt along with my grandfathers business. When she first told me they were inheriting his debt I told her that you don't inherit debt (at least I'm pretty sure?) but she said that it was really the business they were inheriting, and with that a lot of money owed.\nAs for how his smallish business got into so much debt, I'm not sure. He was diagnosed with alzheimers recently but looking back we think he may have been showing signs about 10 years ago, and made some bad business decisions. His diagnoses has steadily gotten worse and worse since his diagnoses though, and he's not all there any more, so I don't know how possible or ethical it would be to get him to sign a new will?\nI don't have many details but if anyone here could point me in the right direction for some resources or tips to pass along to my parents I would REALLY be grateful.\nThanks in advance!

Ownership of the business can be transferred and the debt is still valid, but only against the assets of the business. If your parents can't make it a viable concern again, they could have it declare bankruptcy and shut down. All of the business assets would be liquidated and go to paying off the debt, but their personal assets would be protected.\nIf it's just set up without limited liability, my understanding is that the creditors would get claim on all of the estate's assets before any could be distributed to family members by the will.\nIn either case, with amounts of money this large, you need a real lawyer for a consultation.",

She moved into a house with her sister, her sister's husband and her brother and they agreed to split the rent.  It was an informal agreement and everything was working well, but she moved out a few months ago due to a personal issue with the brother-in-law (I don't really want to get into details, but he did something inappropriate).  The others then picked up her portion of the rent.  Then they were late on rent one month (according to them) and their landlord sent them an eviction notice.  My friend never got her name taken off the lease and she's concerned about how the eviction will affect her credit.  She also (naively) co-signed on a car loan for her sister/BIL.

        "prediction": " Evicting someone from property you own has no effect whatsoever on that person's credit.\nEvictions are often confused with collections or judgments against a tenant because some landlords file lawsuits when they take possession of a rental unit back through court proceedings, which would be reported on a credit report if successful.

        "answer_1": "The eviction doesn't directly affect the credit score, but the collection items from unpaid rent (if there is one, there usually is) will.  What the eviction usually does is prevent someone from renting again, so she needs to be very honest with the next landlord as to what is on her record and what actually happened.  Some other documentation that she moved out long before the eviction would be nice.  I am a landlord of semi-low-income housing, and eviction is about the only deal-breaker on the application.

She is afraid of saving/investing too much. Because of the way she grew up, she has it in her head that having more than enough money is somehow bad. My desires for having greater wealth is to 1. Provide for our own family and live comfortably 2. Use the excess to help others and save for the future needs of our children and grandchildren. I'm not planning to drive a brand new car or buy my wife pearl earrings, but I want to earn as much as I can so we can do as much good as possible.

        "prediction": " Peer-to-peer lending (and any other form of investing) should be evaluated on its own merits rather than in comparison to \"this sounds like a good idea.\"\nPeer-lending returns tend to be higher than bonds and lower than stocks, but they still carry risk. In particular:\n1) Losses can happen. Some borrowers default or fail to repay their loans. The platform will typically provide some level of protection against losses through reserve funds, but there's always the possibility that you could lose money if things go wrong.\n2) You don't know what you're buying when you buy into a funded loan. With a bond, at least you get a prospectus detailing interest rate, maturity date, credit rating etc. When you purchase a loan from a marketplace lender, all you really know is how much it costs per year and whether it has paid off so far. If you want more information, you might need to dig around for it; many platforms don't publish detailed statistics about individual loans.\n3) There may be tax implications. Depending on where you live, income earned from peer-loan investments might be subject to state or federal income tax.\n4) It doesn't diversify your portfolio well. Each individual loan represents only one asset class, whereas traditional investment vehicles offer multiple classes simultaneously. This means that if something goes wrong with peer lending, you won't just see your net worth drop by X% -- instead, you'll also face a significant change in expected return based solely on the performance of those specific assets.",
        "answer_1": "It may well be an excellent addition to a diversified portfolio. Personally though I won't touch it until it's gone through at least one crisis-and-subsequent-regulation cycle. At the top of my mind:\n\n\nWhile some P2P companies are actually P2P, most look a lot like banks. They allow investors to deposit/withdraw money very quickly, while the loans they make are for multiple years. This plus a lack of regulation (and associated capital requirements) makes me nervous.\n\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the companies have 'provision funds' which compensate investors in the case some of their loans default. These funds typically run to a few percentage points of the loans made. This seems like something that will fail spectacularly in bad times, and some companies have strange protocols on what to do when that happens.\n\n\nMany of the companies are looking to seize as much market share as possible, and I suspect this will drive them to silently lower the creditworthiness of their lendees. Look at how the sale of MBS drove banks to give mortgages to people who really shouldn't have had mortgages.\n\n\nHere's a good article that details a lot of the issues:",
        "answer_2": "No.\nHere's why:\nBasically, P2P lending is high risk for the lender and the interest rates demanded reflect that reality.  Additionally, interest rates can be jacked up (oh, you might be promised (\"as much as\") a 10% return, but the actual interest rate could be as high as 20%, which is in payday loan territory).  The main problem with P2P lending is what happens at default.  Usually the organizing company tells you \"sorry, better luck next time, now fuck off and here's how to write it off on your taxes\".  Meanwhile, they go after the debtor over the long term to recover \"their\" money, of which you will never see a dime.  The second failure mode is that they stick their snout into the borrower's cash flow via factoring agreements in the contract at the first missed payment.  They then settle your half of the loan at a below par rate (you were promised \"as much as 10%\", but they report the missed payment, say the borrow is in default and give you 2%... you should just be happy you got your money+2% back... meanwhile they're consistently extracting 7% each month via factoring)."

If all those assets were owned by one person, they would also lose their investment when the company was liquidated. In practice though, most companies have multiple owners who may not even know each other exist - e.g., employees owning stock through various 401k plans, shareholders holding common shares traded on exchanges, etc. Each group of people with ownership interest in the company would receive whatever payouts came out of selling off the company's assets during the bankruptcy process, assuming they had valid claims against the company (e.g. unpaid salaries, loans, taxes) in the first place.",
        "answer_1": "It depends.  most of the time the owner is separate from the company so their personal belongings aren't subject to the bankruptcy.  In some cases an owner of a business won't do this.\nExample.  You make cupcakes.  You buy a little store, hire 2 people to help and sell cupcakes out of that store.  You probably had to take out a loan to get that store, maybe cupcakes aren't selling great and you can't keep up on your employee's paychecks.

Maybe a few months on utilities.  Maybe rent/mortgage payments for the property, maybe the last paycheck for employees?  Well you are on the hook for all of that, and can't afford it so you declare bankruptcy.  you couldn't afford it so you just tell everyone \"I don't have the money to pay you\" and all (well, most) of your debt is forgiven.  You have to pay what you can but certain things you own are protected (your home almost always, often a car ect ect).\nNow if you make cupcakes and decide to open a cupcake store you could make Cupcakes LLC or Cupcakes INC.  Then the company you created would buy/rent the store, would pay your employees and bills.  And if the company ran out of money and declared bankruptcy, your bank account is safe because you didn't declare bankruptcy, the company did.\nIn the first example you own the ingredients, you own the store, you own the equipment.

There are a lot of trees that separate the properties and overall it\u2019s not a dealbreaker for me just yet.

        "prediction": " This isn't going to affect your decision, but you might want to know: most water towers aren't actually \"water towers.\" They're elevated storage tanks used by fire departments or other emergency services to store large quantities of potable water when they need access to a nearby source quickly (usually during fires). In many areas with modern plumbing, these structures are now called \"standpipes\" because they don't hold actual drinking water.  \nA few things worth considering:\n\nIt won't be visible unless someone gets out of their car and walks closer than 15 feet. Most people wouldn't even notice it if they drove past without stopping. You may never hear anything about it again once you buy the place.\nThe odds are extremely low that anyone will care about having a water tank near them when you sell the property. As long as it doesn't violate local zoning laws, there should be nothing preventing you from selling the property.\nIf there ever were a problem where the tank needed repair, it could cause temporary disruption to service. However, if you bought a home with municipal water supply, then the tank is probably owned by the city. If the tank does require repairs, chances are good that they'll take care of it before letting it get so bad that it becomes a concern for residents. Again, though - this is highly unlikely.\nWater towers themselves do not pose a flooding risk; however, standing water around the base of the tank can. Depending upon how much rain falls locally, the ground underneath could become wet enough to cause issues, especially if the soil is prone to erosion.

In short, a bond is a credit promise, you want the highest yield, with the lowest level of risk, this is where credit analysis comes in. Bonds are by far the largest asset class when you consider the many types Gov't + Corporate bonds that exist, but in order to keep this short, you want high credit quality (ability to make timely promised payments in terms agreed) and higher yeild. \nNaturally this an inverse relationship in which bond traders (including computers using HFT) are looking for value by buying 'cheap' bonds, most commonly used metric would be the spread relative to its credit rating, which is a measure of credit quality given by he ratings agencies. The spread would be the distance in percentage bassis points that a particular bond you're looking into trades from their peers, so, assuming everything else is the same among the peer group, you're looking for the higher spread (highest yielding bond). The peer group is usually based on credit rating.  Note that the natural relationship is that the lower the rating, the higher the yeild. \nBonds are a whole particular universe and a larger chapter of finance. [It is definetely worth taking up a look, and this could be a good place to start to read about credit quality, credit ratings, interest rate risk and spreads.]( \nAs for ETFs, depending on the riskiness of bonds you seek for your portfolio, you could use a variety of things. Vanguard's BLV tracks the performance of the Barclays U.S. Long Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index. \nAdding bond exposure is also a good way to 'anchor' your portfolio or parking some cash, though keep in mind the main risks all bond face are interest rate risks, as their yields are worth less once the risk free rate rises, and hence they're expected to lose value once/when the FED raises rates. \nThe main thing you should take away from this is that it is almost always a good idea to add at least SOME bonds to your portoflio to anchor your portfolio, and improve its risk adjusted return by providing a steadier base and relatively lower, abut also steadier income than stocks. \nYou can find [tons of bond ETF that are long/short on different typees of bonds here](  It will mostly be a matter of how much to add to it, and what level of risk you want in your bonds. \nThe old adage (not very scientific butt provides a ballpark figure) is to have a portoflio mix of (100%- AGE%) in stocks and the rest in bonds, e.g if you're 30, that would be 70% stocks, 30% bonds. I hope this helps as a start. Good luck with your reading!",
        "answer_2": "Current teaching is to consider all income streams when calculating asset mix, ie, both your human and financial capital. If you work a job that pays a salary without much fluctuation, or in other words, acts like a fixed income investment, then you're safe to be 100% stocks. For example, if you're a 25 year old accountant who gets paid the same salary each year, that fixed income stream for the next 35 years discounted to present value is far larger than any sum of money you could invest today. So you are already 99% weighted to fixed income, so feel free to put it all in stocks. Its later down the road when you save up half a million dollars that the weights start to change.\nHowever if you work a job that has pay more correlated with the market, like an investment banker, you're better off putting a good chunk of money in bonds, because you already have equity capital market exposure in your salary/bonus pay.\nNote: This assumes a lot of things, not to be taken completely at face value, as each persons' finances are unique."

        "answer_1": "\nShould I start saving for a down payment for a house or squirreling it in a Roth IRA?\n\n10 to 20 years is a long time away and the tax laws may change. At the moment, however, you may withdraw up to $10,000 from your IRA for a down payment on a home. This is for \"first-time home buyers,\" which is a loose term that actually means \"anyone who has not owned a home in the last 2 years.\"\n[Source]( \n\nShould I even touch the Roth for anything other than retirement?\n\nA Roth IRA is an amazingly versatile savings vehicle. Because your contributions are post-tax, you can withdraw the entirety of your contributions at any time, without condition, tax-free. If you put $5,000 in your Roth IRA this month, you're free to pull out $5,000 next month without consequence.\nYou may not, however, pull out any earnings from your Roth IRA until you reach retirement age (59 1/2)^1. Still, it's a great deal: tax-free growth and the option to use the principal as an additional emergency fund. It should probably not be used as your main emergency fund, because your Roth investments are likely to be riskier than cash holdings.\n[Source]( \n\nIf not, how should I save for a large expense that's at least 10 years down the line but with no certainty as to when it will happen?\n\nIf you already have a 6 month emergency fund, I see no reason not to invest your \"downpayment\" into a Roth IRA. Especially because your career may increase your income down the line and make you ineligible for a Roth, it's good to open one early in your career. I get the impression you're starting out since you are uncertain if you'll be settling down or purchasing a property in the near future.\nI think Roth is the best option, but if you'd rather not, you could always look into [laddering CDs]( ^2 or high interest checking accounts.\nI have a 3% high interest checking account and just opened another 4% interest checking account. You have to meet certain requirements, such as a minimum number of debit transactions each month. Google \"high interest checking\" to search for an account you can apply to, either in your local city/state or online.\nBest of luck, hope that helps.\n1: Except certain special situations, such as the first-time home buyer situation, as stated explicitly by commenters below.\n2: Unfortunately, CD interest rates have dropped significantly since this article came out.

        "prediction": "\nI have about $1200 saved up and was wondering if anybody had any advice on how and where to invest it to make more money...\n\nNo one here can tell you that with certainty because the answer depends entirely on your financial situation. Here's what we know:\n\nYou are saving money. That is a good thing!\nYour income is currently less than $1200 per month after taxes. This means you should not be spending all of this money; instead, put as much away for retirement savings as possible while still covering basic living expenses.\n\nSo here's some general advice:\n\nContribute enough to your employer-sponsored retirement account so that you get the full match from your company ($5K in 2014). After doing that, max out an IRA contribution. If you're over age 50, contribute another $6k into either type of retirement account.\nNext, focus on building an emergency fund equaling three months' worth of essential living expenses. Once you hit that milestone, keep contributing whatever amount you were setting aside each pay period toward retirement accounts until you reach the next level of savings goals.",
        "answer_1": "Since this is the first $1200 you have saved up, you probably don't want to invest it in the stock market. Instead, you want to use it as your emergency fund.\nYou describe yourself as a \"broke girl\", but you're not anymore! Broke people live paycheck to paycheck. They make money, and then spend it immediately. They're close to being broke again by the time they get their next paycheck.\nTake that $1200 and promise yourself that you will NEVER live paycheck to paycheck. Always have enough to be one paycheck ahead. And then make it two paychecks ahead. Eventually you want to get to the point where you are about 3 months ahead.\nOnce you have that 3 month buffer, you can start investing money (probably in a Roth IRA, using a target date fund or total market index funds). If you work for a company with a 401k, you'll want to contribute enough to get the full company match. But right now focus on building that buffer.\nThe reason for this buffer is that life is complicated. Unexpected things happen. Your car breaks down. Your pet gets sick. For someone who lives paycheck to paycheck, any unexpected bill is a disaster. But for you, it's not an disaster anymore! You just take your savings and pay off the unexpected bill. Think of your emergency fund as your superpower. You become stronger, tougher, and more resilient than people who live paycheck to paycheck. \nI'm not sure if you can open your own bank accounts at 17, but once you turn 18, you'll want to keep most of your emergency fund in a savings account that pays you around 2% interest or more. (Lots of online banks like Ally and Discover have good interest rates. But the megabanks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo will rip you off by paying you 0.1% interest or less).",

We originally had another couple living with us, but they turned out to be a nightmare and left 2 months into the lease.

Originally they said they'd settle the $4500 out of court, however they sent me a letter saying they weren't going to pay unless we filed it in court.

I do have bank statements showing that I withdrew $900 on the 1st of each month but I'm not sure how that'll hold up.

        "answer_2": "This is from my own very limited experience, comparing my wife's credit union and the major regional bank where I have my deposit account.\n\nMy bank has a much better online platform than her credit union.  The credit union actually uses a third party site just to offer PDFs of account statements.  My bank's site can initiate ACH transfers, pay bills online, and much more.  My wife's credit union cannot.\nHer credit union's loan offerings are much more limited.  Mortgages are capped at $350,000.  (That's an irrelevant restriction for us because in our location, that's enough for plenty of house, but it would be tough in San Francisco.)  In addition, they do not offer points on mortgages or many other forms of loan product flexibility.  But the rates are pretty reasonable and they don't charge origination fees (in fact, they even ponied up extra cash towards closing costs for our mortgage).\nHer credit union's depositor-service offerings are more limited, too.  They don't even offer an ATM card or credit card.  Getting direct deposit set up was easy enough, but the only way we've ever made an actual withdrawal has been by sending an email to an actual human being at the credit union to authorize the transfer, which was verified by a return phone call placed to us.  No online funds transfers, no actual branches where one can walk in and withdraw money, and like I said, no debit or credit cards.  I don't even think they offer checks.  We certainly don't have any.\nThe current dividend on shares (equivalent of interest) at the credit union is 0.75%.  At my bank, it's 0.25%.  Of course, both of those are lousy, that's just what interest rates are like right now.  But the combination of the fact that (a) it's easy to get money into the credit union (many people at the Fortune 500 company it's associated with simply have a portion of their paychecks automatically deposited there), (b) it's a little bit harder to access once it's there, and (c) it earns at least a little bit more interest while it's there, means that she and most of her coworkers use the credit union as a savings account or a place to put some money away little by little to build up for major purchases, while using a more traditional bank for everyday cash management needs.\nHer credit union largely ignored some black marks on her credit history when she applied for a loan.  We were denied for a mortgage loan by two local banks because of her credit.  I don't think her credit union even pulled her score.\nHer credit union approves loans with dramatically less paperwork than traditional banks.  As in, the total volume of forms for our mortgage was four pages.\nHer credit union is dramatically less leveraged than almost any bank I've heard of.  They release their figures monthly, in a newsletter that looks like the local high school newspaper editor did it in his spare time.  In September, they had about $170M in deposits (shares) and $30M in outstanding loans.  Bank executives would probably be on the verge of getting fired if they were so risk-averse.  Usually those numbers will be flipped and more in the commercial banking world.\n\nI'm sure that there are other credit unions that are nothing like my wife's company's, and I'm sure there are plenty of regular for-profit banks out there that have antiquated tech as well.  But those are the differences I've noticed.  And for the record, I'm pretty happy with both my bank and her credit union, and I'm glad that the overall financial landscape in this country is such that there's room for both."

I went to my local Honda dealer looking for a car I had already found online. Once I found out it was there, I was pretty much already at the point of being sold on it. It was a Honda Civic 2016 LX with only 36,777 miles and no issues or past accidents for $13,677.\nI got with a representative and we started talking about my car credit. Well, I had absolutely no car credit, since this would be my first financed car, so the guy told me I would have to put a larger amount down on the car. I originally came in with the intention of only putting down $2,000 max out of my $3,580 in savings down on the car. So, when I said $1,500 and the guy asked if I could put $2,000 instead to increase my chances of getting a loan, I was a little discouraged but understanding since I had no credit and I really wanted this deal. The guy then walks to the back to give this information to the banks. After about 20 minutes, he comes back and asks if I could put down $2,500. I start getting a little annoyed at this point, but I agreed none the less. He walks to the back and I wait about another 20 minutes. The guy comes back and, this is when I get really freaked out, he says that the bank is willing to give me a loan, but I would have to put down $3,500. I sat there for a solid minute to think this one out, but I really wanted to get a car to start a new job I've been looking at for a while and I didn't want to die in a junker vehicle, so ultimately I decided to go for it. I was getting my paycheck in a few days anyways and I live with my father, so it didn't seem like too much of a risk. Once I'm signing papers, I end up getting to the part where I see my APR and loan term. This is where my bum is starting to feel a little sore. It was a 6 year loan with a 25% APR. And so now, I have a car that ended up being $25,000 instead of $13,677. \nWith my position right now, I feel like I can manage the payments, but what I'm asking here is: Is there a better way to handle this loan now with the circumstances? Should I try to get a co-signer to lower the APR and payments? If so, could I do it with my current loan, or should I refinance? If I do that, do I refinance now, or in two years?

Ideally you'd try soon, as hopefully you don't owe more than the vehicle is worth.

One I got in October of last year - the other one I've had since April.  The job I've had since April is now offering me full time which comes with a hourly wage almost equal to the first job with a whole ton of awesome benefits as well.  So I definitely want to do that instead of continuing to work 60+ hours a week.\nIn the past I have always used the two-week notice as a professional courtesy.  This job that I want to quit now though - only giving a two-week notice would almost undoubtedly screw them.  I only have 4 other co-workers in my \"department\" and we are split among 3 zones and are all part-time with other jobs.  Zones in this context is just cities and towns in about a 50 mile radius.  One of these zones is solely my responsibility.  I work with clients in my zone who I meet with during my workday.  I have clients booked up with me throughout the next 3 months.\nTo do my job requires me to be certified by the state and involves at least a month of training alone and then some for paperwork, etc.  So me quitting would mean a scramble to hire someone else who would undoubtly need to be trained to get certified before they could even start to take over for me.  I think this could take my employer 2 months or more to do.\nBut I really don't want to keep working this job for all that to happen.  I don't really have any bad feelings for my employer; I'm just in a position to have something better right now.. That is just how it goes.  However, that being said; I'm offered absolutely no benefits from this employer and I believe I am being paid $2-$5/hr less than my co-workers (which would put them at or around $20/hr).  But even if they offered me a good bump in pay I still wouldn't see it as worth it compared to being full time at the other job and having a better work-life balance.\nIf I wasn't so worried about feeling guilty I would just give my two weeks, be done and not worry about leaving them high and dry.  But I'm typically not that type of person.  So I want to give my employer the option of keeping me a little bit longer and instead giving a 1-2 month notice or some sort of staggered leave where they could continually reduce my schedule over a set time period (like 3 months).\nHowever, if I gave them an option like that, I would kinda want them to make it \"worth my while.\"  I just wouldn't have any idea how to bring that up without sounding like an absolute scumbag.\nShould just skip all that and just give them a 2-3 week notice and leave them to figure their own shit out?  Or should I offer to stay longer if they work something out with me?  If so how should I go about brining that up?\nAnd just to be clear- I'm not trying to take advantage of a situation to pry money out of the employer... I would be just as happy if they had someone to replace me and I could just up and quit.\nSorry for the wall of text. [/INST]",

For example, if you put $10K into a 2065 fund today, it would be mostly stocks (80% or so).

I\u2019m new-ish to the US and still learning such things. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " There is nothing you're missing, but here it goes:\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between putting money into a Roth IRA and just using an investment service like M1 Finance?\n\nThe main differences are these:\n\nMost importantly: taxes. You pay no tax on your contributions or any growth in your account when withdrawing from a traditional brokerage (M1). When you take distributions from a Roth IRA, all that comes out tax free. The only time this changes is if your income exceeds certain thresholds; at those points, some or most of what you took out will be taxed as ordinary income.\nRoth IRAs have annual contribution limits ($6k per year for everyone) which apply regardless of how much other savings you have. In contrast, many people can contribute up to $57k annually to various types of retirement accounts combined ($24.9k to 401(k), another $18.5k to Traditional IRA, plus whatever you put into a SEP or SIMPLE plan); others may not be able to save anywhere near that amount because they earn too much.\nTraditional brokerages do not have required minimum distribution rules once you reach age 70.5. If you leave funds in a Roth IRA after reaching age 70.5, you must start taking RMDs each year by December 31st. Failure to comply with RMD requirements results in significant penalties. For example, let's say you inherited $1 million from Great Aunt Mabel and invested half in a Roth IRA and half in a traditional brokerage account. At age 70.5, you must withdraw roughly $36k from your traditional brokerage account each year. By failing to make those withdrawals, you would owe a penalty equal to nearly $100k! That doesn't happen in a Roth IRA.\n",
        "answer_1": "A Roth IRA is a type of account that has special tax implications. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but you don't have to pay any capital gains if you withdraw after you're 59.5 years old.\nM1 Finance is a broker- a company that will hold your money in an account and let you buy and sell stocks using the money in that account. You can open a number of different types of accounts at M1 Finance, including a [Roth IRA]( ",

        "answer_1": "Median U.S. income currently stands at $56,516 - rounding that to $60k we can thus calculate (with some highly simplistic assumptions) using historic return numbers that generating this amount from investment income will hypothetically require an invested capital of:\n\n$1,200,000 in treasuries at 5%\n$1,000,000 in investment-grade corporate bonds at 6%\n$800,000 in high-yield corporate bonds at 7.5%\n$600,000 in S&P 500 appreciation at 10%\n$48,000 in biotech YOLOs at 125%\n$20,000 in forex YOLOs with 500:1 leverage at 300%\n$1.83 in a HYIP with guaranteed 9000% return in 24h\n\nFrom here, things get a little more complicated. Inflation might be eating at your invested capital if you consume the entire annual return rather than reinvest some of it, so you might want to realize a bit more gains than you need to support your lifestyle. But how much more? That would depend on your inflation expectations, the volatility expectations of your portfolio, taxation, etc.\nYour costs and required annual income will also vary depending on where you live, your family composition, and your lifestyle choices. Many costs which often form a part of a compensation package for an employee (such as healthcare) will be payable by you directly.\nFinally, even a fairly diversified portfolio is subject to a range of risks, from market risk to a prolonged depression - your portfolio can simply fail to perform to historic expectations within the finite time-frame of your life on earth.\nThus, while realizing the equivalent of a median U.S. household income from investments is [definitely feasible](  the wisdom of relying on this as your only source of income during your productive years is dubious.

        "prediction": " Once you hit the magic number (usually $59K) that triggers RMDs:\nRMD = Required Minimum Distribution\nYou must take out at least that percentage of your 401(k) balance every year starting April 1st following the calendar year when you turned 72 years old. The minimum percentages go up as follows:  \nAge 72-73 - 3%\nAge 74 & older - 5%\nThe distribution period is based on your life expectancy table found here:  \nFor example if you turn 78 next year, your first RMD would be around $6,726 ($215,000 / 3). You then use that calculator to find out what the distribution period is: 14.9 years. So you will need to take out approximately $456 per quarter beginning April 1st. If you don't take it all by December 31st, you will owe taxes on the unwithdrawn portion.\nIf you want more than the required amount, you may choose to do so. Some people choose to delay taking their initial RMD until later in order to give themselves an extra \"income boost\" during early retirement. Others might want to take a little less than needed just because they enjoy having the flexibility.",
        "answer_1": "It works like any other investment account where you can sell the investments and withdraw the money into your bank account at any time (just pay income taxes on any traditional 401k assets withdrawn).\nHow long / how much you withdrew is totally dependent on the balance of your 401k. If you have only saved $100 in there then you can only withdraw $100. Or you can probably set up automatic withdrawals, or whatever else you want.\nThere are required minimum distributions with traditional 401ks, which requires once you are 70.5 years old you must withdraw a certain percentage of the balance in a given year, that percentage increasing every year. But you can always withdraw more than that amount, assuming you have the funds to do so.\nI think the 4% safe withdrawal rate is a pretty good strategy, where if you were invested 50% stocks 50% bonds you could theoretically withdraw 4% of the account balance every year (adjusting for inflation each year) for at least 30 years without running out of money.",
        "answer_2": "The rules for what you can do with a 401k in retirement depend on your company's plan.  Some will let you set up periodic withdrawals, some let you take out money at any random time and amount you want.  Others only let you take a single post-retirement withdrawal, of the entire balance (In which case, you should roll it into an IRA).  They can have fees for setting up periodic plans, or not, or have fees for every single withdrawal.  \nRolling into an IRA is common, because then you can shop around for one you like, rather than having to go with the rules your former employer set."

As such, assets of $1.25M would support a 4% withdrawal rate of $50k for the first year, increasing with inflation. That last bit is important. There is an assumption that your assets will grow by at least 4% after inflation, meaning you can take out more than $50k after the first year, and so on, to keep up with inflation and keep your real spending power constant.\nThe last bit I wanted to say is about \"in the bank.\" These assets would need to be invested in a combination of stocks/bonds in order for the interest to be enough to support this kind of income.

They mean \"what happens to the value of a currency when it changes hands.\"\nSo if you owe money on a loan denominated in Argentine Pesos, or borrow more money in those pesos, then an increase in interest rates means that the peso becomes worth less relative to whatever else you can use to pay off that debt.\nThis makes sense because who would want to take on new loans in a country where the central bank has just jacked up their interest rates so high? It also makes sense why the currency drops: People start dumping their pesos into foreign currencies before the prices go any higher.",

        "answer_2": "\"Interest rate\" is how much you pay to a lender who gives you money. \nIf interest rates are high fewer people want to borrow money, so the amount of money in the economy is smaller. \nLess money means that each unit of money is more valuable.

        "prediction": "\nIm a very curious person when thinking in the long term.\n\nNope!\nYour question is based on an incorrect assumption: that your goal of getting high credit scores (>750) has any sort of connection whatsoever to having a good credit history. It does not.\nIn fact, if you were trying to build a really strong credit profile, it would be exactly opposite from this:\nYou want to keep your utilization as low as possible (ideally below 30%), so you'd always aim to carry a balance. That way, your average age of accounts increases, which helps your credit score. You also want lots and lots of \"on time\" marks, since those are weighted much more heavily than how much debt you have relative to available credit. So, again, carrying a balance every single month makes sense.",

I quit my job 3 weeks ago (right after Labor Day) after being with the company for 6 years, and my employer was pretty upset about it.

The following week, I received a pay stub with the entire amount in the Insurance Deduction line and $0.00 in the Net Pay line. When I called and talked to the secretary she said the entire amount went towards insurance, and that the company paid for 2 weeks, I paid for my full 4 weeks, plus the 2 weeks the company was supposed to pay (the company and the employee each pay 50%). I was never asked if this was ok, and I never gave them permission to do it. Can they legally do this?

I contacted my state's Workforce Development, who put me in contact with my state's Labor Division.

It's shitty on the company's part that they didn't explain it, but it seems what they did is completely legal.

        "prediction": "\nWill every major studio really have a separate streaming service?\nYes, absolutely yes. Disney already has ESPN+ and Disney+ coming soon (which are essentially redundant since they're both basically Hulu). WarnerMedia is launching AT&T TV Now next year. Comcast owns NBCUniversal which already has Peacock in development for early 2020. Amazon Prime Video is expanding its original content production (and it was already doing this) to compete more directly with Netflix. Apple is spending $6 billion on original content over the next three years. The list goes on.\nWill there be 3 or 4 big bundles?\nProbably not. There are some obvious bundling opportunities:\nAT&T could bundle all of their services into one package (HBO Max, DirecTV Now, & AT&T Watch).\nDisney could merge Disney+, Hulu, & ESPN+ together (I don't know if they would want to though - they might feel like ESPN+ should remain as an exclusive sports-focused platform; Hulu is primarily a general entertainment brand while Disney+ is focused on family friendly programming so maybe they wouldn't mind having them separate brands).\nComcast could probably bundle Xfinity TV, Peacock, & NBC Sports Gold into something interesting but it'd likely require significant changes to each product.\nApple doesn't really make sense here. They offer Apple Music, iCloud, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, & Apple Arcade... none of those products overlap with anything else mentioned above except possibly Apple TV+. So unless they plan to heavily discount one or two things to get customers interested in signing up for Apple TV+ then Apple isn't going to have much leverage in negotiations about bundling.\nWill Netflix combine with another company?\nNo. Netflix is profitable ($5B net income last quarter), growing rapidly ($8B free cash flow last quarter), and generates enough revenue ($19B annualized) to pay off most any debt anyone wants to throw at them.

But I just took on a new job where I get 50% match and there are ~2 months left in the calendar year.\nDoes it make sense to withdraw all my existing 2017 401k contributions so that I can refill it with funds from my new job and my new employer's 50% match?\nNot sure if my understanding of taxes is correct, but I'd have to pay the following (to gain $9k match):\n- 10% early withdrawal fee on $18k\n- Fed and State taxes on $18k\n= approx $1800 + $7500 = $9300\nBut I'd have to pay the Fed and State taxes on another $18k anyway if I didn't do this.

        "answer_1": "tl;dr: You're not the first, nor last, person whom has switched companies mid-year and gone from a so-so 401k to a much better/awesome 401k. The IRS has legal mechanisms to move your money around without incurring 10% early withdrawel fees or whatever.\nThe other posters are correct in a very narrow interpretation of where you're going at with your question.  Your question is this: I maxed out my 401k contribution limit with an old employer. My new employer has a better 401k matching policy. What can I do?\nFirst off, you should until the April 2018 filing deadline to rectify this situation. It happens all the time where you switch employers and sometimes numbers get messed up and you over contribute to both.\nSecond, the 401k administrators, as part of being 401k administrators, have the ability to refund your contributions for the exact reason you specified.\nThird, the specific mechanism you mentioned in your post --- that's where the posters are going after as being underhanded and illegal. Yes, that will raise flags with the IRS.\nWhat you should do now: Max out your 401k in 2017, as much as you can, for the remainder and then contact your old 401k administrator for processing refunds. I might wait until 2018 starts since at that point, 2017 earnings will largely be set in stone.",
        "answer_2": "You likely won't be able to get ahead this way.\nIf you contribute to the new employer's plan, the government will require you to withdraw all the money and any gains on that money by tax time.\nThat money will be taxed twice as income, so you can expect really low rewards on that front.\nAdditionally, if you take money out for this reason, the employer will almost definitely take back any amount they matched to your account.  Your amount needs to be in for the match to be in.  Your amount won't be in, therefore...\nI think there is nothing for you to gain by trying to cheat the rules this way."

        "question": "[INST] [UPDATE] Negotiated salary on entry-level job/lab position; offer rescinded. :-( I can't believe this happened. The boss himself said there is a \"small room for negotiation\" when he extended the offer.\nThe offer originally was for $28k for bachelor's with zero experience in an academic lab. I had a bachelor's and have 2 years part time unpaid relevant experience and 2 full time, paid summer internships with relevant lab experience.\nI looked up various threads / websites on how to negotiate. I went on Glassdoor and Payscale and looked up averages for that particular position for the company. The average was about $31k-33k. People said to add 10% - 15% to the amount and attempt to negotiate with HR.\nSo I called HR and asked for $35k; expressed enthusiasm for working in the company, etc. They came back and said the boss would paid maximum of only $29k and if I wouldn't drop my \"requirement\", they'd consider other candidates.\nWithout hesitating, I quickly told them I'd be happy to take the $29k and I'd love to work for the company as it was a very good environment. I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way and I thought they were open to negotiation (which I originally asked the HR too before naming a number).\n5 hours later, received a call from HR letting me know that the boss has gone with another candidate and my offer has been rescinded.\nI feel so sad and defeated. I've been dealing with depression for the past two years and finally feel like I am getting my act together and doing something with my life. The first offer was a god-send, even though the offer was low. I wanted to negotiate to an amount that would allow me to survive independently and afford the raising rent prices, but would have been extremely happy with a job in a good lab environment with a nice boss. I think the advice from internet sites regarding negotiating salary did not apply to entry-level lab positions in academia where I'm essentially dispensable.\nI don't know what to do at this point. I have one other interview lined up and waiting to hear back from other positions, but I feel so down. Was I wrong to negotiate? Did I come off as arrogant? Was the amount I quoted too high? What should I do in the future to ensure this does not happen again? [/INST]",

That means they really weren't interested in paying more than $29K for whatever reason. It could be due to budget constraints or just not wanting to pay market rate. Whatever their reason, it doesn't matter now -- it means they were never going to give you more money regardless of whether or not you tried to ask.\nYour situation isn't unusual either. This happens all the time in hiring. Sometimes companies say they are willing to negotiate, sometimes they aren't. In most cases, it depends entirely upon who makes the initial offer. If you get an offer above market rate, then sure, try to push higher. But if you start out below market rate, then forget it. Your initial offer was probably lower simply because they expected you to negotiate anyway.",
        "answer_1": "I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way\nSalary negotiations can be very delicate, despite all the hard-ball internet advice - most of which is wrong, or at best appropriate only to unique candidates with very highly sought after skills.  It's possible your description that you were just messing with them abuot $35k in order to get the offer up might have hit a raw nerve.  In general, expressing interest and asking (nicely) for a better salary should have been fine.  Your ask seems fine.  When they come back lower than you asked, your acceptance and positive interest in working there should have also been fine.\nRescinded offers are unusual.  Either they are a terrible company to work with, or your description of your tactics bothered them (this will be someone never happy) or maybe they just found some sucker to work there for $25k.  They won't tell, so you just have to move on and look for another opportunity.\nA company that cannot pay very well and acts so odd about salary negotiations is probably not someone you wanted to work for long term anyway.  Time to move on to other prospects.",
        "answer_2": "I know it's been beat to death, but just to give you some perspective on why you get rejected: If your salary desires do not align with what they can provide, you are a flight risk. Not only that, but asking for more than the average salary when you're fresh and not even skilled enough to be asking for average (let alone +10%), it can reflect poorly upon you. I always suggest negotiating if you think an offer is raw, but be prepared to lose it, and always be realistic. 35k on a 28k offer probably wasn't the best advice."

I see a lot of homes  in areas I would love to live in advertising rent to own situations.   It seems too easy to avoid the banks for a year or two while living in the house I'd end up buying.  Is it a good deal or just a scam? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Rent-to-own is not an investment opportunity; it's a way that unqualified buyers get into houses they can't afford yet:\nRenting to Own Basics: The Problem with Paying More Than You Can Afford\nThe \"rental\" part works as you expect - monthly payments go towards the purchase price (or whatever other obligations are built into the contract). But here's where things start going wrong:\nA common feature of most rent-to-own arrangements is that you agree to pay more than market value for your rental property every single month. This means that if you were to decide to walk away from the arrangement and move on down the road before closing on the place, you will have paid thousands of dollars extra over what you could have bought the same house for had you simply gone through traditional financing. In fact, we estimate that renters typically spend between $15,000 and $30,000 more when using rent-to-own compared to the actual cost of owning the property under conventional terms.\nSo if you want to know whether rent-to-own is a good idea, ask yourself this question: If someone offered me a car loan requiring us to pay twice as much per month as similar loans available elsewhere, how long do you think I\u2019d keep making those higher payments instead of taking advantage of lower rates somewhere else? Exactly \u2013 one second!

        "answer_1": "It's not necessarily a scam, but it's usually more expensive than buying outright. The reason being that many of these transactions do not end up in a sale, so there is more risk of damage to the property and need for repair on the seller's part.

Or you if you can frequently check your bank accounts without feeling stressed, there's another one. \nI just got my card with 800 $ credit limit. Did some research, using a lot of your credit isn't the problem, its using a lot of it then having it on your monthly statement.

I got a cash rewards card with not a lot of restrictions on redemptions and I have been buying EVERYTHING with it. Because I do this for every 50 dollars I spend, I make a payment.

There's nothing wrong with living with my parents, I just wanted to move out to experience living with friends.\n\nIf this is genuinely true, and you're not going into extra unnecessary student debt to afford living on your own, then I would stay living with friends. I moved back in with my parents after college and honestly it was difficult. We get along great but the relationship just feels different once you have lived on your own and trying to figure that out can be challenging. It also can definitely have a negative effect on your social life as a student--this isn't financial but I think it's worth considering nonetheless. The people I rented a house with during my junior and senior years of college are some of the only people I have kept in touch with from that period of my life and living with them taught me a whole lot about life. Even just basic things like dealing with the cable company when the internet goes out, interactions with your landlord, figuring out how to navigate shared spaces with people who aren't just the family you've been with your whole life are all critical skills you'll have to learn at some point. College is a better time to do that than when you're in your first job working long hours and stressed. If you can afford to live outside your parents' house, I think the experience is worth it, but if you're paying rent with student loans you're likely better off moving home.\nThe majority of people on here will tell you to move back home because in pure financial terms, it's the more economical choice. But one thing that this sub is sometimes guilty of is forgetting that your finances aren't the only part of your life.

        "answer_1": "Investing in teal estate is not much different than investing in the stock market. \nWhen thinking about stocks consider that companies can underperform and even go out of business. No stock is risk free. You may buy a stock that has great long term potential as a buy and hold. You may buy other stocks that are in emerging markets and have higher risk.\nThe same connections can be made with real estate. Some properties are great for buy and hold. You may want to keep them indefinitely. They have low risk and a high upside.\nOther properties may he in fluctuating markets. The risk may be higher. You may have stagnant populations and job markets.\nThe other reason is to free up capital and lock in returns. You do not have a real return on investment until you have sold that investment. At the sell the return becomes real and the cash can be invested again.\nYou really do not want to own paid off properties. Part of the leverage on returns is having a payment being made by a tenant. If a tenant is essentially paying your loan payment then you are maximizing the leverage. \nFor example\nYou buy a $100k property for $20k down. Your tenant is paying the loan on the borrowed $80k and you are still getting a profitable return. When that loan is payed off then you are making a return on what may be a $200k property and $200k of your cash instead of $20k of your cash. That is not a great investment especially if the lease payment has not gone up by over 1000% in that time frame.\nWhat you can do is sell the property for $200k and reinvest that $200k return into five more properties worth $200k each with a $40k down payment. You now have $1 mill in properties purchased with $200k and lease payments that are paying down the loans. \nYour tenants can now pay down the loans on those properties until you sell and take real returns. Those real returns can once again be reinvested. ",
        "answer_2": "I work in Commercial Real Estate so I can give you a ton of reasons, but a few major ones:\nEveryone has a different expectation of the return they might make on a property. Just using a random round number, 10% might sound really good to you, but bad for another person. So a lot has to do with expectations of return.\nAlso, maybe this investor needs to sell to pay off another asset, or obligation. You never know at first, which is why the story behind the asset is so important.\nFinally, sometimes sellers aren't sophisticated. Maybe they're not managing the property well because they don't know the market well, what rents are, etc. Or maybe there's a good reason to fix up the asset but they just can't see it. These are just a handful of reasons."

First time posting here let me know if this doesn't belong here.\nI (30M) am married and have had our house for coming up on 5 years. We have approximately 130k in equity in our home and have around 88k left to pay off.\nWe live in a growing City and are thinking about buying another house to rent out for some passive income.\nMy understanding is that if we bought a house with a mortgage it would have a higher interest rate for it being for a rental instead of a primary residence.

Thus keeping my interest rate low and bringing in maybe an extra 10k a year in rent. \nIs this the right idea? Are there any pitfalls I should know about? Should I focus on paying off my current house which could take maybe 5 to 7 years. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Pitfall: you don't understand what \"rental\" means when talking about mortgages, so you're not even close to correct.\nFirst off, your assumption is incorrect - most lenders will actually offer better rates for investment properties than owner-occupied homes because they see them as less risky. The riskier part comes from...\nSecondly, yes, getting cash out of your primary residence using a HELOC or other loan against your existing home is generally considered poor financial advice. If you really want to do this, make sure you can afford to lose all of that $130K+ equity.",
        "answer_1": "One of the perks of REI is utilizing other people\u2019s money (OPM) to leverage your investment. By owning a rental right out you negate this advantage entirely on that property. You also will have less cash available to renovate the house or keep in reserve because it\u2019s all tied up.\nThat being said owning a rental outright is fantastic for your cashflow because you have no debt service. But it comes at a cost of putting all your money in one basket. If you were going to do buy and hold with cash you might as well just invest in REITs or eREITs.Much better liquidity and no dealing with maintenance or tenants. \nUnless you\u2019re competing with multiple offers and want to be the most attractive one I personally wouldn\u2019t ever go 100% cash.",

        "prediction": " Leveraged etfs are not meant for \"long term\" holding. They aren't even meant as trading tools; they exist solely because people will buy them anyway so might as well offer them.\nLeveraged funds work like this: when you buy shares in one, your initial cash is used to purchase shares at full price. Then every day after that, there is a rebalancing where they sell enough existing shares to cover whatever amount was needed to maintain leverage (usually between 2x and 3x) and then use those proceeds plus any additional cash you added during the day to buy more shares at half price or less. This means the daily return you see from these things can be very high, but only lasts until tomorrow morning.

You do this over and over again, hoping each day that the losses won't happen yet. Eventually they always do.",

Since these structured funds have to renew their future contracts all the time (most daily, monthly is the rare max), they realize losses frequently.

I am in my mid-twenties, and I have $24500 in debt: $8500 on a credit card (I've been a young idiot, I know), and $16000 in student loans (and I have already gone through a consolidation).  I have recently committed to paying $300 (just less than double the minimum payment) towards my credit card every month (and I no longer use it at all), and I pay $200 towards my student loans every month (which currently sits at a $0 balance, with no payment \"due\" until 2019 because I am so far paid ahead).  I am very committed to paying down all my debt over the next several years, and I am in a good position (with no account for additional income: raises, bonuses, etc.) to do so.\nBased on creditkarma, my credit utilization is at \"D\" (the limit is $9000, and until recently I relied heavily upon the card as a \"back-up\", which I now realize will kill me in the long term if I can't pay off the balance in full each month, and I am determined to get rid of it), my payment history is \"A\" (I have never missed a payment on any debt), my age of credit history is \"F\" (only 1 year and 9 months, although I have had my credit card since 2009?), total accounts is \"B\" (19 total, 15 closed, 4 open - 1 credit card, 3 student loans), credit inquiries \"B\" (1 hard inquiry), and derogatory remarks \"A\" (none).

Sometimes the information that you have on the house is incorrect  (eg- the home only has 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom when you thought it was a 3/2).\nThere are many risks purchasing at auction so you need to make sure that you buy the home at a sufficient discount in order to not get burned when the unexpected arises.\nBuying foreclosed homes that are bank owned is much easier.

Auction or liquidation value (lowest), market value (what we think of typical real estate transactions), and insurance value (highest value). \nLenders (GSE anyway, hard money lenders may be an exception but rates are steep) have minimum property requirements and standards and will not loan on houses that do not meet these. Many REO and auction properties either do not meet these or they are a risk for GSE lenders because they have not been inspected or appraised. They sell cheap because the only buyers are those with plenty of cash (although as has been mentioned, there are often cash buyers competing for these). \nIf someone needs a loan, they will be buying at market value, not auction or liquidation value. It is possible to buy a fixer upper at the low end of the market, such as if you do a 203K rehab loan, and put in some improvements and sweat equity to add value. But in general, the big discounts are going to cash buyers and they get a discount because of the risk and unknowns, and also because the only market is other cash buyers. \nBuying auction/liquidation is a very specialized and risky thing and no first time home buyer should even attempt this.

Wait until you are financially stable before investing.\n\nis 20k enough to get cash flow from a rental property without having to flip it?\n\nProbably not. Rentals require significant upfront costs: down payment + closing fees + repairs + moving expenses + security deposits + utilities while vacant.

Read a ton go to investor meetings listen to podcasts all that good stuff. I'd talk to a lender and figure out what you need to qualify for an owner occupied loan youll need an income and tax returns getting a co signer will help but the bank needs to know you can keep the payments up. You can start with under 20k of course this is market dependent but for this particular strategy its more than enough.

Basically, it sounds like you don't particularly want a house, you just want an investment to park your money in for the next ten or so years -- so why would you immediately jump to buying a house instead of the much simpler option of investing?  Investing in stocks isn't particularly complicated.  It's way less complicated than closing on a house, anyway."

        "question": "[INST] [DEBT] Settlement offer on defaulted student loan...not sure what the best choice is. I have one student loan that went into default when I was unemployed several years ago. The rest of my disbursements are in good standing as they allowed me a forbearance during that time, but Sallie Mae was an asshole so here I am.\nI got a letter from the most recent collector my account was assigned to, and they are offering me a settlement. It's less than I originally borrowed and I can easily pay it right now. However, I don't care even a tiny bit about what is moral or right, I just want the most positive result for my credit score.\nSo, here's my dilemma. I know from annualcreditreport.com that this loan will cease to show up on my credit report in a year and a half. As far as I understand it, that means no one will see that the charge off/default ever happened. That's fantastic because I have had tremendous trouble getting a car loan because of this defaulted debt.\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years. I'm aware of pay for delete agreements and such, but the settlement offer doesn't contain any such offer and I don't know if I want to mess with that and just trust that they'll follow through. So, my first big question is does anyone know if this will actually help my credit, or if I would have better results by just waiting a year and a half for it to fall off and never touch it again? \nMy other concern if I do decide to take the settlement is that, since this is through a private collection agency, somehow the info will never properly get communicated back to Sallie Mae (well, Navient now). I assume as long as I keep the offer, a copy of the check I pay it with, and other documentation I can quickly shut down any future agency that tries to collect on it as well, but I'd rather not have to deal with that hassle forever. Is there any other good way to make sure this really ends forever with my payment? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You should read the fine print:\nDoes your agreement include language like \"This release includes all claims arising out of or related to the above-referenced obligation(s), regardless of whether known or unknown at the date of this Agreement.\"?\nIf yes, then you need to wait until it falls off your reports. If not, then settling will update your account status to \"Paid Less Than Full Amount\". This will impact your credit scores for seven more years.\nAs to how to ensure proper communication between yourself and the creditor after you send them money, use certified mail return receipt requested.",
        "answer_1": "I used to work in the industry, and while I am not an expert by any means, I think I can help point you in the right direction (take it all with a grain of salt though).\nIf this is a federal loan, then you cannot discharge via bankruptcy, and they don't even need to sue you to start garnishment (kind of like the IRS).  There is also no SOL, and you should try to take care of this as soon as possible.\nGetting passed around to different collection agencies is not good, and a typical indicator of more drastic measures being taken in the near future.  You should also ask them to verify the debt to ensure you are paying the right loan with the right agency.\nThe default status is what is killing your credit report, and it will not go away until 7 years after the account is \"closed\" either via charge off or settlement.  They do seem to be willing to be reasonable, so I am sure you can get them to agree to report this as settled on your credit, which should help you out (especially if this is your only bad account).  I have seen people bounce back from chapter 7 bankruptcy in just over a year, so you should be able to do the same if you are careful.\nYou should not have a problem with them reporting the settlement to the loan servicer.  They will not get paid until the loan servicer pays them, so they are highly motivated to report correctly.  You can always ask them to put into writing anything you are not certain of, please do not just trust them to do something without talking to them about it.  This is more for documentation purposes, in case you have any additional issues come up with the account (especially with the credit agencies or a new lender).  Also request a final letter once the settlement has been paid.  They probably already do this, but it should be mentioned just in case.",
        "answer_2": "\nMy concern is that paying the loan will get the status updated to \"settled for less than full amount\" or something along those lines, and thus bork my credit for another 7 years.\n\nCredit reporting is always based on the date of first delinquency, no matter whether you pay the account or not. If you pay it, it will still fall off 1.5 years from now.\nDo your research on the collection agency, too. Find out what tactics other people have used."

        "question": "[INST] IRS 401k Non-Discrimination Test How do you guys deal with the 401k non-discrimination test? \nI received an email from my company stating that those who make more than >120k are considered highly compensated individuals and therefore are capped at 10% before-tax contribution - meaning if you make <180k, you would never be able to contribute to the IRS limits of 18,000/year. \nI haven't really looked into the actual law that closely but it really irks me that I won't be able to contribute the max $18,000 in 2018 (thankfully, I didn't meet the limit in 2016, so I'll be okay for 2017). It's frustrating because my income is already taxed 40% and being able to max out my 401k and my HSA is one of the only ways I'm able to reduce my taxable income. I don't really understand why these limits exist when people with higher income also get taxed at higher rates already...\nFurthermore, when we take money out of our 401ks it still gets taxed anyway. :\\\nRant aside - what do you guys do to compensate for this? And who do I have to write a strongly worded letter to help get this repealed?  [/INST]",
        "prediction": " The rules were put in place specifically to prevent high paid employees from essentially using their employer sponsored retirement plans as a way around paying their fair share of income taxes.\nYou should not expect any sort of change here given current political realities or economic conditions.",
        "answer_1": "You can talk to your company about offering a \"Safe Harbor\" match in the 401k.  If the plan meets the criteria for Safe Harbor, the discrimination test doesn't apply and you can put in the full $18k.   Or you could help the company increase participation by lower paid workers, so maybe the company can pass the test.\nOr you can change jobs to a company that does have Safe Harbor match.\nIn any case, you are much more likely to make a useful change if you try something locally, like changing your employer (or changing your employer, ha).  If you really want to waste time with a stern letter demanding changed legislation, start with your state Senators or district Representative.\nI put up with this one year at a company that promised they would change.  They added a match and all was well.  At another company, when the 401k becomes an employee anti-retention plan because of bad policies, the top talent leaves to find a better employer.  Do what you need to do.",
        "answer_2": "I wonder what the implications for this are if you're also doing the Mega Backdoor Roth (After tax 401(k) -> Roth IRA) contributions while simultaneously contributing 18,000 pre-tax. In the event you receive money back from your plan, which contribution type takes precedent? I imagine it would possibly come from both types if you contribute far too much relative to others in your plan. Regardless, this could cause real headaches for people."

        "question": "[INST] HIRING MANAGERS: Are company 401k policies usually negotiable? I move employers a lot. I tend to get bored after a couple of years and look for a new challenge. This has served me well as I usually get a nice little raise every time I move. Every company I've gone with has had a policy that 401k can't be contributed to until you're there for 6 months. At that rate I'm unable to contribute almost 1/4 of the time. I plan to retire early so and recently realized this is hurting me.. a lot.\nI always negotiate salary and it usually works out. I've never tried to negotiate 401k policies though and I think it may be something I should try. Would a company ever remove that 6 month restriction during negotiations? At least meet half way and allow immediate contributions but no matching until 6 months?\nI'd love to hear from someone in an HR/Finance department to clarify if things like this are usually negotiable within an org.

        "prediction": " No, not at all likely they would consider removing the requirement or changing when employees could start contributing. It's probably written into your employee handbook (if one exists) and is a legal requirement under ERISA.",
        "answer_1": "No. Company 401k policies are NOT NEGOTIABLE.  The company is required by law to have the same policies for all employees in the group.  Some very large employers have multiple groups, with multiple 401k plans with different rules, but these are rare exceptions and even then they are required to put employees into the appropriate plan by some definitive rules, such as subsidiary A employees into plan A and subsidiary plan B employees into plan B.\nMany legal restrictions exist to prevent employers from favoring select employees, such as highly paid workers or management.  This also means that they are legally restricted from waiving rules like waiting periods, vesting or modifying matching for select favored employees.  You will NOT be able to negotiate different 401k rules for a single employee.\nThere are no legal restrictions on vacation policy, time off, work from home rules, benefits such as health care and so on.  Some companies (usually smaller ones) do allow negotiating benefit packages and employee/employer costs for benefits.  You can also negotiate sign-on bonus and severance agreements.  But you are legally not entitled to different 401k treatment from all other employees.  Attempting to negotiate 401k rules is a waste of time.",
        "answer_2": "Not exactly what you asked but just an fyi, there are legal restrictions on matching so that part isn't something you're likely to be able to change.\nBut you can still max it for the year even if you can only contribute a few months of that year."

I drew the floor plan and from everything I've seen he's followed it down to the last detail with very good work.\nI also drew the exterior of the house but it's not the same work from the subcontractor. My main complaint is that the roof was to be extended on both sides of the house by 16\" however it was a photoshop I gave them without actual dimensions.

        "prediction": " There isn't one.\nThe only answer that makes sense in this context is \"it depends.\"  If you are looking to buy your next vehicle as soon as possible after buying your last one because you don't like driving old cars then there's no ideal time period.  On the other hand if you want to maximize resale value or minimize repair costs then it does depend:\nA brand-new car will lose about $10% (or more) of its value every year.  So if you plan to keep the vehicle for less than five years then waiting until it's three years older may not be worthwhile - but if you expect to own it for ten years then buying when it's two years newer might make sense since you'll save around $2K.\nOn average a used car loses about half its original value over four years so if you expect to drive it for six years then you should wait until it's two years newer before purchasing - again saving roughly $3K.\nIf you expect to drive it longer than seven years then you can probably afford to pay whatever premium comes with being slightly newer.",

In the 6 years I've had it, it's hardly needed any repairs beyond regular maintenance like battery, tires, timing belt, etc.  \nI probably wouldn't buy a car that old or with that many miles if it hadn't been a commuter car, though.  And in the used car market, I feel like it's not that a X year old car is necessarily a good deal (or a car with X miles).  If you watch the market for a while, you'll learn the market price for cars at a certain age or with certain mileage, and you'll be able to spot a good deal when you see one.  A 5-year old car at one price might be a much better deal than a 3-year-old car at a higher price, if you get what I mean."

That's what I believe, and that's what the OP asked.\nSmall note - unless you are Jewish, you aren't \"tithing\" - tithing is more or less an Old Testament requirement.  NT requirements are a little different... we're required to give \"joyfully\" which is a bit open ended.  So to call it a tithe and just label it 10% falls a little short.  [Here is a pretty good article about that.]( \nI chose to give post tax, because I don't see any of that taxed money.  I don't really feel it'd be wrong either way though, as I'm supposed to give cheerfully (2 Corinthians 9:7).  I should give as much as I can, with the fact in mind that 10% is what was required when the law (OT) was not perfect.

I also increase my giving when I get a raise or whatever.\nNow I'm not saying any of that is easy.  Sure I could do a lot with that money.

I recently increased my monthly payment from the minimum of $120 a month to $300 a month - I'll have my loan paid off in April 2024 and my servicer will have gotten more than $1,700 in interest from me.\nTo be honest, I'm sick of looking at this debt.

Make sure they know that you normally stay because there is too much work to complete in your shift - but that for that one day you have an appointment. Then at 5:00, leave. If your boss has to step in and wrap up the work apologize but you have to get to an appointment. And that's why you told the boss that in advance. Hopefully this will be a wake up call that they need to fix the situation. Keep making appointments and heading out at your normal shift time until it changes.\nGood luck. ",

        "question": "[INST] Are there any realistic options for using my 401k for anything other than retirement? I was hoping you guys might be able to help me out here. I'm 20 and working a decent job. They have a good 401k plan which I'm currently contributing as much as they will match. The issue is I don't really know if there is anything I will really be able to do with it.\nI won't go into a lot of detail, but I have a fairly serious health condition. Realistically I know I won't live to retirement age. The average life span for someone with my condition is 36. The top age would be about 50 (which would be a miracle).\nI'm not trying to be a pessimist-but hey you gotta be realistic. I don't want to invest all of this money and never be able to use any of it. Now I'll also say I know changes in medicine can happen and who knows maybe a cure will come out for me, so with that in mind I can't totally omit the idea of retirement. But again, being realistic it's not likely that will be the case.\nWith that in mind- Is there anything I can do with my 401k? I've read what I can about about it and I see there are pretty big penalties for withdrawing early for buying house or whatever other reason. I did see there is a possibility of using it if something medically comes up, but the details with that got pretty complicated. Is anyone able to offer some insight? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Yes: yes, there are things you can do with your 401(k) before retirement age. However, these fall under two categories:\n\nYou die or become disabled while employed by the company, then you get access to your account balance without penalty or taxes. You may still choose to pay income tax on your distribution at ordinary rates.\nIf you leave employment prior to vested age 59 1/2, you must either roll over the entire amount to an IRA within 60 days, or take a \"hardship\" withdrawal equal to the lesser of $5,000 per year ($15K total), plus the amount necessary to satisfy your financial hardship OR three times your compensation from your current employer during the preceding calendar year minus any amounts already contributed to qualified plans through the end of such year PLUS any additional catch-up contributions allowed under section 414(v)(2) of the code made for the same year. In addition, the portion taken as a hardship withdrawal is subject to both regular federal income tax and a 10% premature distribution excise tax. You cannot recontribute the funds back into your plan until the next calendar year after you turn age 59 1/2.\n\nThe only other option is taking loans against your account; however, this has its own set of restrictions - generally you need to continue making loan repayments on time to avoid having the principal and interest paid out counted towards one of the above conditions.",

(The payments under this exception, except in the case of death or disability, must continue for at least 5 years or until the employee reaches age 59\u00bd, whichever is the longer period.),\nMade to a participant after separation from service if the separation occurred during or after the calendar year in which the participant reached age 55,\nMade to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO),\nMade to a participant for medical care up to the amount allowable as a medical expense deduction (determined without regard to whether the participant itemizes deductions),\nTimely made to reduce excess contributions,\nTimely made to reduce excess employee or matching employer contributions,\nTimely made to reduce excess elective deferrals, or\nMade because of an IRS levy on the plan.\nMade on account of certain disasters for which IRS relief has been granted.\n",

How to calculate the equivalence of a pension vs retirement savings accounts. \nSo, I am one of the lucky few to have a pension. I am already vested. The way it is structured is based on years worked, age and highest average earnings over a 3 year period. Just got a promotion last year. Am in the last few stages of my pre FIRE life. I'm trying to evaluate whether to work 2 1/2 more years or 1 1/2 more years. \nI will be able to meet our expected expenses (with some room to spare) with 403b, IRAs and pension in 1 1/2 more years.  But, if I worked one more year, I would get about $8k more per year in my pension (67k vs 75k per year).   This would give us a nice cushion. \nBut, my job is quite stressful with this promotion and I don't know if it's worth it. \nOne way to calculate the worth of a pension would be to value it at the 4% withdrawal rate. So, 8k would equal $200,000 in a retirement account.  However, when my spouse and I both pass, there will be no assets left from this theoretical sum. So another way to calculate it would be to estimate my life expectancy and then a withdrawal rate that would spend down the principal in that time. I think this would be around a 8% withdrawal rate for me.  That would mean that an 8k increase = 100,000 in retirement savings. \nAny thoughts on this?  \nThe reason I am asking is that most FIRE or other retirement calculations are based on a pot of money that you withdraw from and not from a pension. \n$8k per year is a nice reliable increase, but frankly, my stress might not be worth it.

",
        "answer_2": "There's a rule of thumb that every $100/month of pension is worth about $18,000 (alternatively$1000/yr = $15,000) at retirement. This means that this extra $8k of pension could be worth around $120k (similar to your math). Obviously, to get a more accurate number you have to factor in inflation, age, life expectancy, etc. That being said, a $67k pension is quite a nest egg already (worth about $1M) so the answer depends on your expenses and whether the pension is inflation-adjusted.\nTo help with your FIRE calculations, I would recommend the [\"Rich, Broke, or Dead\" Early Retirement Calculator](  treating the pension and other benefits like Social Security separate from your investments in the \"Extra Income\" tab. This will give you a probability of whether or not you will have enough money in retirement."

        "question": "[INST] Student Loans Broken Into 10 Different Accounts. 2 Late Payments Dinged My Credit 10 Times Each. Advice Would Be Appreciated Hi all. I have almost a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet that I have been paying on for a couple of years now (terrible I know). Late last year, I hit some hard times and missed a couple of payments (again, terrible, I know). Because my Nelnet account is split 10 different ways, they hit my credit 10 different times for each late payment, resulting in 20 negative statements on my credit for only 2 actual missed payments. \nI tried to work with Nelnet to consolidate those late payments into just two, but they were unwilling to work with me on that. After some more research, I ended up disputing the late payments with the three bureaus. My justification simply asked that they consolidate the missed payments down to the two that actually occurred.\nLast week, I received a statement from Equifax saying that the account information on my Nelnet accounts had been updated, which I thought was good news, but further inspection showed that all the late payments were still present.\nFast forward to today when I checked my credit report on CreditKarma to see that the late payments with Nelnet had ballooned from 20 to 40. Additionally, my recorded payment history went from something like 650 down to 447 payments on file. \nHow is this possible? The adviser at Nelnet suggested I consolidate, which would not take care of anything in the past, but might look good on my credit report. Essentially, those accounts would be closed down and a new one opened up. Can't this hurt me?\nI am now in a great financial position, but I'm being smothered by the mistakes of my past. I want to buy a house and start progressing a little bit, but I'm stuck. What can I do? I'm lost.\nThanks for reading. Any advice is welcome. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Your dispute letter did nothing:  \nThe fact remains: you are obligated to make ten separate payments. You cannot erase them even if it means your score tanks.   \nYour options are:\nA) Suck it up, double-down on making regular timely payments so you don't get another ding until next month, or...\nB) Consolidation. Yes, closing out these loans will help your score, but you need to understand why:  \nWhenever there is an account delinquency, lenders consider the entire account as having gone unpaid - because you didn't pay. By closing the old loans and opening a single consolidation loan, the old ones go away and show \"on time\" repayment going forward.",
        "answer_1": "Well. You don't have \"a six-figure federal loan from Nelnet\", you have 10 federal loans all serviced by Nelnet. Each loan was disbursed separately, and can have varying terms. Borrowers typically end up with 1-2 loans per year, one subsidized, one unsubsidized.\nSo yea, you actually have 10 loans, and 10 missed payments each time. If you look at the credit bureaus reports they'll show the 10 accounts too.\nThere's pretty much nothing you can do about that.",
        "answer_2": "I'm in the exact same position. Just call nelnet or w/e other lender has your loans and consolidate into 1. I've talked to them and there's no penalties (of course everyone has different terms) for consolidating into 1 account and making a single payment a month. After you make a few payments your credit will start to skyrocket. Only takes a few payments to see results. "

This is an important conversation that should not be rushed through or done without careful thought on both sides.\nThere's no one right answer here - it really depends on what works for you two. Here are some common methods:\nCombine all accounts into one joint account (checking + savings) where both of you can access everything equally. Each month, split up whatever bills come out evenly between you based on income levels. Split any discretionary expenses in half if there isn't a clear agreement otherwise. Both parties must agree before making large purchases over X dollars (e.g., $500).\nJoint account only. One person handles most of the household budget stuff. The other party gets their share automatically deposited each pay period / weekend. If they want something extra, they ask the primary financial manager. They get a set amount every time this happens.\nIndividual accounts. Keep separate bank accounts. Pay all necessary bills from whichever account has enough funds at the end of the month. Any remaining balance goes towards savings/discretionary spending. Spouses keep track of personal spending separately. There may be a limit on spending above a certain level per month unless approved by the other partner first.",
        "answer_1": "We were of the opinion that we're fully in it together once married, so I no longer consider things like \"my income\" or \"her income\", but rather \"our income\".  We deposit everything into one checking account, and we have a budget that we both agreed to.  We adjust the budget whenever our income changes or a debt/savings goal is reached.  During these adjustments, we talk about whether things like the food budget has been working for us, or if we want to start saving money for a pet in the future.  It really helps to discuss our short-term and long-term goals before going through the budgets, so we have the right mindset.\nWe only started having \"play money\" budget lines for each of us once we were out of credit card debt.  I'm of the opinion that entertainment-type budgets should be either cut completely or extremely low while in credit card debt.

[/INST]",
        "prediction": " There's two main reasons why we don't see a stronger labor market response from lower unemployment rates right now:\n1) Wage stickiness (the second part of your question): Workers have historically been very slow to accept new jobs at higher pay because they expect their current employer will match any increase in salary if they leave.  This makes workers less responsive to changes in supply-and-demand conditions for labor.  If you think about this intuitively, if I get a raise today, there is no reason not to assume my boss won't offer me more money when he has to replace me tomorrow.  \n2) Low productivity growth: Productivity measures how much output each worker produces per hour worked.  It looks like wages aren't rising fast enough relative to overall economic health because businesses aren't producing stuff faster than before.  One possible explanation for slower productivity growth could be the lackluster rate of technological innovation over recent decades.   \nThe good news is that these trends should reverse themselves soon since both factors look likely to change going forward:\nWage stickiness: As millennials continue entering the workforce, younger people tend to place more value on career advancement opportunities than higher compensation.  This means they're more willing to switch jobs even without expecting a matching offer -- which gives them more leverage with existing employers who can't afford to lose valuable employees.\nLow productivity growth: With technologies such as AI and automated manufacturing becoming increasingly commonplace, many industries face pressure to adopt better practices or risk falling behind.  Some evidence suggests that investments in training programs may help improve employee skills and motivate more rapid adoption of technology.",
        "answer_1": "Automation and international labor (outsourcing, offshore manufacturing, etc.) are two huge pressure-relief valves that open up whenever wages start to climb.\nAn employer will quickly say \"why pay higher wages, when for that price I could have a computer/robot/machine customized to do this job, or have it done in a cheaper country?\"\nThe latter is extra scary since that cheaper country may also have lower environmental protections and labor protections.\nThe former is extra scary because automation, once figured out, is easily copied in large numbers and just gets cheaper.",

If you have other goals, or worse, consumer debt, backing off on the retirement saving so you can meet that goal is fine. You say you want to buy a house. Buying a house is a good goal. You can have it paid off by the time you are retirement age, which would help a lot with monthly expenses. I would still try to get the full company match. For example, if your company matches 5%, and your putting in 10%, going down to 5% for a few years is okay. If you just stop contributing altogether, you are leaving money on the table.\nNot everyone has the same idea of what retirement is. A lot of people share this idea of never working again, and just lounging around all day, or traveling. Other people (including people like Warren Buffet, who's 87) never retire in that sense. Instead they do work that they enjoy, secure in the knowledge that they could quit at anytime and still be well off financially. That's what financial independence is. Having an income from a job is nice, but having your 401k, IRA, etc after 59.5 means you aren't dependant on that income.

        "question": "[INST] Turns out my knee surgery was at an out of network hospital. We owe $20k. February 29 I had ACL surgery. I've been with this doctor for 4 years, he's operated on this knee before, but at a different hospital (Lakeside Hospital, new orleans).  So we have history, they know I'm with Aetna.  So when they told me I needed surgery again we went ahead and scheduled it, my Dr told me it would be at a different hospital, Omega Hospital. A couple days later they called me and confirmed that my insurance approved everything. \nWent for my preop appointment the week before surgery, did all the blood work and stuff and then met with the finance lady at the hospital. She ran all my information and told me we would have to pay $500 and that would be it.\nWent in for surgery, paid $500 the day of, surgery went smoothly, went for my follow up with my doctor a week and a half later, everything seemed normal. \nToday, we got the EOB for the surgery and were totally shocked to find out that this hospital was out of network, and our outstanding balance was $20,000.\nI am so overwhelmed and stressed out about this. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do. I don't have $20k laying around. I cook for a living, I don't make the big bucks.\nAm I totally screwed?\nEDIT: FINALLY the doctor called me.  The hospital will write off the $20k since we have out-of-network benefits.  This doctor does a lot of surgeries here and this happens all the time, they said.  Thanks everyone for your help and advice.  What a huge sigh of relief! [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You are not \"totally\" screwed, but you definitely need to take action ASAP.  \nFirst step is calling them back and telling them you received their bill in error. They should immediately reverse any charges made and cancel the debt collection process if you contact them within 30 days of receiving the first billing statement.\nSecond step is calling your insurer and asking why your claim was denied based upon the provider being out of network. Again, ask them to reverse the denial while you talk to them. It may just be that there was some miscommunication between the doctor's office and your insurer. If that doesn't work, call the doctor's office and tell them you were billed incorrectly. Their medical staff needs to notify your insurer as well.\nIf none of those steps result in resolution, go through the appeals process with both parties involved.",
        "answer_1": "Check with Atnea and see if they have an arbitrator. They can negotiate between you and the hospital. I owed a hospital $45,000 and they got the hospital to right it off, the total bill was over $90,000. They settled for what the insurance paid.\nDavid.",
        "answer_2": "No, you're not totally screwed. Everything else that has been said applies here; plus almost all health insurance companies have 3 deductibles, in network deductible, out of network deductible and out of pocket maximum. It sounds that even if the 2nd does not apply the third will (which is typically around the 6kish limit).\nE.g. my in network is 2.5k out of network is 3k and out of pocket is 6k.\nSo i pay everything up to 3k for out of network, then I pay a copay % of 15% on everything above 3k till I have paid a total of 6k for the year and I no longer have any liability for any health care costs.\nIt sounds very much like the hospital has made a mistake; contact Aetna and the hospital."

        "question": "[INST] Sold my houseboat to guy online, how am I protected? I am the owner of a houseboat, and yesterday I had a gentleman call me from Colorado (the boat is located in Florida) and asked me about wanting to purchase my boat. At first I thought he was messing with me because who buys a boat unseen? \nHe saw my ad on craiglist and wanted to buy my boat and pay three months non liveaboard dock rent (my houseboat comes with a slip.) I agreed and I gave him the pricing six thousand for the boat (asking price, he didn't haggle me) and one thousand three hundred and seventy two dollars for three months of dock rent. \nHe agreed to the pricing and we decided PayPal was the safest bet to send the money. \nHe chose buyer and seller to send the money with me covering the fees ( I offered) and I would send him the title and proof of paying the three months rent and a bill of sale with as in no warranty on it. \nHe did send the money and its sitting in my paypal balance. \nMy question is, can this go wrong? If so, how can I protect myself from  losing my title if it does? \nI want to add that I don't think he's going to screw me over, he was very open with all of his information, very polite and I didn't get any negative vibes from him, but you can never be careful enough.  [/INST]",
        "prediction": " First: You are not obligated to sell your property to anyone just because they agree to buy it. Don't do anything else until you have verified his identity and made sure he has the funds available to complete the transaction.\nSecond: You should NOT accept payment via PayPal or any other third-party service unless you know and trust the person personally. The fact that someone called you out of nowhere saying \"Hey, I want to buy your houseboat\" doesn't mean you should immediately hand over your personal financial details. Not even when people say things like \"he seemed really nice.\" Scammers are often charming; there's nothing stopping an internet stranger from pretending to be Mr. Wonderful and then disappearing without ever sending a dime.\nThird: Even if you verify everything, you still need to cover yourself legally. He could show up at your door tomorrow morning with your title and demand possession of your boat. Unless you have some sort of legal document stating that he cannot claim ownership until you receive full payment, you may lose your boat.\nWhat you absolutely must do before giving anyone access to your property:\n1. Make sure you have verification of their identity through a government ID such as a driver's license or passport. This will help ensure that you aren't dealing with someone impersonating another person.\n2. Get a signed contract which states exactly what you are transferring ownership of -- specifically including any conditions (e.g., payment). Do not sign any documents that include warranties or guarantees beyond what you explicitly stated during negotiations. Remember, once something is written down, it becomes enforceable by law. So if you said you wouldn't give the boat to anyone unless they paid $6000 cash, make damn well sure that isn't included anywhere on any paperwork.\n3. Have them provide documentation showing that the funds were transferred into your account. A copy of the receipt won't cut it here. They should provide photocopies of bank statements or cancelled checks. This proves that they actually sent the money and received confirmation that it went into your account.",

But you really need to take extra steps to protect yourself.\nThat means get his name and address, validate it by getting his driver's license, include any title information, have him sign that and complete the title transfer in person, with you there. Make sure everything matches. If he refunds it via paypal you have the info to sue, if it's fake you will know that the title was marked up with fake info and can go about the process of getting it voided (though it's probably already void, if he filled it out with fake info he won't get that boat registered anywhere and won't be able to sell it) and then the boat can be reported stolen.\nAs long as the transaction is done in person, with a written signed contract, you can just sue in court to get it if a refund is attempted. I would not do it if he refuses to come out in person and sign."

I would love to learn what goes into some of the calculations and the statistics behind it all. Just point me in the right direction and i will take it from there.  [/INST]",
        "prediction": " The wiki is your friend:  \nThe Black-Scholes model has an extensive mathematical history that dates back over a century (Black & Scholes, 1973; Merton, 1976). It's based on the idea of a \"riskless\" asset which is used as the underlying security for the option. This allows us to use continuous time mathematics instead of discrete time, so we don't have to worry about dividends or interest rates changing the price of the stock during its life. Instead, we focus solely on volatility changes impacting the value of the option. We then assume that the riskless rate is known with certainty, allowing us to calculate the present value of future cash flows discounted by this rate. Finally, since the only thing that really matters when calculating the value of an option is how much it costs now compared to its expected payoff at expiration, we simplify everything down to these two quantities - present value and payoffs. In order to make things more manageable, we introduce several simplifying assumptions such as no dividend yield, no change in the underlying stock's volatility, and no chance of bankruptcy (the latter assumption is why we always talk about implied volatilities rather than true ones). When combined with the riskless rate assumption, these simplifications allow us to determine the theoretical fair price of any option given its strike price, maturity date, volatility, and current market conditions. That's basically the entire story of pricing options using the Black-Scholes formula!",

This means that when you hear them talk about certain strategies for making money through real estate, they may be talking about methods that work well for them personally - which doesn't necessarily mean they would work for everyone else.\nScott Trench comes across very strongly as someone who is passionately against conventional wisdom like paying down debt aggressively before getting into real estate. He believes this type of thinking holds back many aspiring REIers. While he does raise valid points about why you might not want to do so early on, his blanket statement that it always makes sense to dump all your extra cash towards building equity isn't entirely accurate. There are plenty of examples where paying off high-interest consumer debt can make far more financial sense. You need to listen to him and consider his perspective, but ultimately decide whether it aligns with your own personal situation.\nTheir podcast interviews tend to feature guests who either already have made millions in real estate or have built up massive followings themselves.

I'm familiar with where you're house is and the area. \nI took a look at your listing and my original thought is you're massively overpriced. The rents in that area are low and you're in the middle of nowhere. I can't speak for all investors out here, but at that price point you can't compete with houses in BR that will attract the LSU crowd as well as families. The only people that want to live in that area are going to be people that grew up in that area. The house also needs work. The first things I would do is paint all the dark wood white, redo kitchen counters, add new appliances, and something needs to be done with that bathroom. I'd estimate 10-15K in costs. For a similar sized house in similar shape in BR I'd expect to pay 80-100K. Sure, I wouldn't have the yard you have, but I would never want that sized lot for a rental anyway. All in all, I think you're making a mistake trying to market as an investment. \nYou're also competing with so many houses that just got remodeled/flipped from the flood. I have a buddy that just bought a totally updated house that's 700 sq/ft larger than yours off of Millerville (closer to civilization) for about 20K less. \nI think you'd be better off just lowering the price and selling to someone who wants to stay in that area and is already comfortable seeing trailers here and there.\nIf I were you I'd ask my realtor to show me these comps again. I can't imagine there are comps supporting this price point.",
        "answer_2": "You have to find some comps. You're looking for overimprovements in nearby or similar hoods. Or you go back in time (years, if needed, how active the market was is not a huge consideration, you're looking for percentage of discount). If the demographics on the other side of town are kinda the same, you can use those places to estimate the discount. It's a fairly complex assignment for an appraiser who has access to all that data, and it's slightly better than a wild ass guess, but it's not as scientific as anyone would like. Would cost $300-$400 but you need an appraiser who likes puzzles not someone who needs a target number to hit. \nJust another option, if the place is on 2 acres can you carve off a couple homesites for trailers (especially if you have utilities already on one). If you sold 2 1/2 acre sites that would be some money in your pocket that would allow you to accept less for the house. OR add this fact (if it's legally possible) to the marketing info and maybe an investor will pick the place up and do the lot split). You say it's listed as an investment but who knows what that means, if you can split the lot make sure that is prominently mentioned in the listing. \nIf you are having showings, I'd not be inclined to drop the price too much (if anything). That means you haven't turned off buyers with the price. Someone will make you an offer, you can counter, and see where you can meet. We get spoiled by markets where things sell in days but realistically 2-3 months is a normal marketing time in many markets. You may need longer than typical marketing time and that's fine if you can hold out for your price. \nAnother thing you might consider is seeing if your agent will get other agents to come take a look and give their opinion on your price. Kinda like they do on tv shows where the realtors tour the flips and say it's overpriced lol. But you will get some opinions from people who work in the area and know the market. It's also kinda guerilla marketing because those realtors have clients who might not have seen it otherwise, it doesn't hurt to have it on more people's radar. "

        "question": "[INST] Car loan gone south. Kiiinda freaking out Ok, so on Black Friday I went car shopping. Went to a dealership to get a car. Had pre-approval on 10000 loan. Prepared to do 1000 in down. (Car dealership had signs saying 9999 for a car. And, my old clunker bit it somewhat suddenly. So I thought,\"cheap new car.\") They only had no feature stickshifts for this price of course. \nI don't drive stick and we haggled for a pre-owned certified automatic for 16000. Not sure if I was getting taken by sales person, but the car was nice and on initial inspection I could afford the payments. So I went for it. Drove off lot after signing papers and  am super pumped about the car.\nA few weeks later I got a letter saying the financing was not approved and loan was denied due to insufficient credit info.\nSo now the loan isn't going to work, what options do I have? Do we renegotiate the loan?(will I get a worse loan?) Do I have to return the car? Do I get my down payment back? I'm going to talk to the dealer tomorrow but I'm stressing and don't know my options.\nTLDR: Got talked into buying more car than I planned for, and now am not approved for the upgraded loan. Don't know my options or if this is a bad situation. New car feels like it ain't pulling it's weight. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " Your options are:\n(a) Return the car. If you signed nothing yet, this is your best choice. You still keep your $1k deposit.\n(b) Return the car, negotiate with them to redo the paperwork based on whatever information they needed that they didn't have when you bought the car. This might be possible; some places will let you make changes to an existing application before finalizing the loan. It also depends on how much money you lost by being \"talked into\" spending more than you were prepared for.\n(c) Keep the car, try to find another lender who can give you the same terms as originally offered at the dealership. Depending on whether you were really pre-approved, this may be difficult since many auto loans require you actually take possession of the vehicle first, which means you couldn't shop around until then anyway.\nThe last two depend heavily on why they rejected the original loan application.",
        "answer_1": "\nGot talked into buying more car than I planned for\n\nThen this loan falling through may be a great situation for you. They most likely gave you the car on the condition that the loan would go through (check your paperwork for such a clause). It did not go through. So you can either try to arrange your own financing or else return the car and get your down payment back. I suggest the latter.\nAnd be sure to use this as a learning experience - always know the maximum you can afford, never go over that, and do research on the particular car you are looking at before you buy. Don't simply trust that whatever random car the salesman shows you is fit for your needs.",
        "answer_2": "Talk to the dealer first and foremost and find out who they actually had the loan approved with. If they spot delivered you (delivered without an approval in place), your contracts will show no lienholder assigned, so review them and find out what institution, if any, picked up the note. \nOften, especially with less than perfect credit, we do what's called \"shotgunning\". The finance manager selects 3 to 4 of the most likely banks to get an approval with, then \"shotguns\" your application out to them. Sometimes one picks it up, sometimes, none do, and sometimes they all do. It really depends. The number of banks go up if you have particularly challenged credit. The important thing is that we are required to send you a letter saying you were denied for credit EVEN IF THE BANK APPROVES YOU! If the terms change from what they originally approved (a counter approval) or if you decline to finance with one of the banks, you will get AAN's from any institution that didn't capture your business or captured your business with a counter approval. \nTLDR: Could be an AAN or could have been spot delivered. If it's the former, don't worry about it. If it's the latter, be prepared to have to fight your way out of a contract that claims you owe money for use of the vehicle (typically $50/day,  $0.50/mile in my state)."

        "prediction": " No, that would be called \"taking out a construction loan\" and you need separate financing for that.\nWhat your lender will do instead is give you an appraisal on the as-is house, add the cost of the renovation work into their calculation of how much they think that house is worth once everything is done. Then they'll give you a new loan amount based off of that number -- so basically what you described: $350k total.",
        "answer_1": "The value has to be at least $350K + whatever % you need to put down. No one will loan you $350K on a $300K house. If the value after renovations will be $350K (and, an appraiser agrees with this because investing $50K into a house will not likely raise the value $50K) then you can do an FHA 203K rehab loan.

Unfortunately you can leave it to New Jersey to turn the shore into slums, so a lot of the towns are either extremely affluent or extremely meth-y.\nWe've been focusing on a town that falls in the middle. Definite split in neighborhoods, mediocre schools, but not terribly inconvenient to NYC where my husband works. Houses in our price range seem to go very quickly.\nToday I decided to switch it up and my realtor took me to a house a little bit inland in one of the most affluent towns with a great school system. The house is small (960 sq feet), directly next to a park, and pretty poorly laid out.\nIf we were to make an offer, we would slowly work on updating different aspects of the house, hopefully eventually adding on a bedroom, additional bathroom, and a laundry room on the second floor. Slowly.\nOn our short list would be knocking down some walls, updating the enclosed front porch, adding central air, and landscaping. I think with these alone, considering comps in the neighborhood we'd add a lot of value to the house, but I'm also a FTHB so what the hell do I know.\nHouse is currently vacant, asking is 299k, homeowners bought the house in '06 for 270k.

If you get a difficult-to-evict tenant, then you're still on the hook for HOA/mortgage/utilities while your tenant is both not paying rent and potentially damaging the home.\nThree, it's not as hands-off as you'd think.

But that's after years of getting things automated to a point I'm happy with.\nFour, long-term asset valuation is difficult. Investing in Detroit real estate probably looked like a brilliant idea back in the 50's. Investing in Vegas and Florida condos was all the rage 10 years ago. Bubbles burst.\nFifth, property appreciation is \"nice,\" but unrealized unless you actually sell. Once you sell, the property is no longer providing any cash flow.

        "question": "[INST] Should I plan to buy my parents an annuity? My parents are getting close to retirement age (60 and 61) and don't have much saved. I haven't discussed exact numbers with them, but I'd estimate they have ~100k in savings. Currently my dad makes ~55k as a truck driver and my mom makes 5-10k part time. They didn't work in the US until age 45, hence the lack of savings. \nThey expect to get 1400/month total from social security once they hit 66. It's not that much, because they won't have been paying in for the full 35 years.\nMy dad thinks he will have to work until he dies. His job is very hard on him -- most driving is at night, his hours are always changing, and he gets very little time off. Coming home for the holidays, I feel very sorry for him. \nI haven't told them, but I'd like to help make it possible for my dad to retire in 5-6 years, around 66. The good news is that their house is paid off, they live in a low cost of living area, and they're reasonably frugal, so if he retired I think they could live on 25-30k/yr. \nI'm 24 and in my 3rd year of grad school working toward a PhD. I live on a 40k/yr stipend, plus about 10k/yr from side jobs. I live with 5 housemates on rice and beans, so I've managed to save ~90k since starting grad school. My income should increase to ~80k/yr when I graduate in 2.5 years, and then hopefully keep increasing slowly if I make it in academia. If I don't, it should increase faster. I don't have any debt. \nSo, the idea I'm considering is: use a large fraction of my savings over the next 5-6 years to buy them an annuity that pays out 1k/month. It appears this would cost me roughly 175k. Combined with social security and their savings, this should hopefully be enough that my dad can retire. This would of course set me back quite a bit in my own finances, but I'm young enough that I think I should still be ok. My parents made big sacrifices career-wise for me and my sister throughout their lives, so I'm willing to take a hit. \nI guess an alternative to buying an annuity would be to just set up an automated transfer to give them 1k/month. I like that the annuity is guaranteed, so they wouldn't have to worry that I would stop giving them money for any reason. I think if I proposed to just send them money every month, they would probably refuse. Same for a lump sum gift. \nDoes this sound like a reasonable plan?

Inflation means that expenses rise over time, especially healthcare costs.  Your parents will likely spend less than half what they currently bring in.\n$175K invested now will return approximately $14K per year after inflation adjustments.  That's only going to cover maybe 10% of their projected annual spending needs.\n\nIf you want to help your parents, put aside funds regularly into taxable investment accounts, such as Vanguard Target Retirement Funds or similar products, where you can control the allocation based on their risk tolerance and goals.

If you lose it, you'll be fine and will hopefully have learned something.\nMy thoughts:\n - Throw some in an S&P500 index fund. It'll give you a reason to pay attention to the market and get a feel for how it moves.\n - Throw some into some companies or an industry you're interested in. You'll naturally start paying more attention to those companies or that industry and be on the way to understand it well enough to do some smarter investing the next time you have money to put in the market.",

Disclaimer: This may not be the place for this, but regardless...\nSo, I'm a 22y/o male still living at home with my mom in Canada. Graduated high school and got my diploma three years ago but I've been struggling to put my life together past that point. Sometime within that three-year period I came down with a partial disability that severely limits my ability to work.\nBecause of this, I've held numerous jobs (cashier, lubrication technician, server, etc.) but haven't been able to hold them because the physical nature of these jobs was simply too taxing and I was forced to quit. I've tried to get on disability but require a formal diagnosis; EKG and MRI scans have shown an abnormality but nothing that doctors can actually put a name to, and hence, no disability.\nAll of this has put severe financial burden on my mother, who is already poor and now struggling to pay bills for two people in the same house as well as my expenses as I have no income. We're on welfare and struggling to make ends meet and she's about to lose her job come January so I know that I need to get my life together now - and I want to, because the guilt of being so useless and undervalued by my family and the few friends I have is gut-wrenching.\nThrough all of this hardship, my only real reason to live and to get my life together was my girlfriend of three years and my best friend of five. I'd (foolishly) been thinking that as soon as I was able to move in with her and we started our life together, things would start looking up, but that relationship ended a few nights ago and I'm now in the darkest place I've ever been in my life with no direction on where to go and nobody to talk to.\nI want to get my life together, and I want to be someone that other people can appreciate and someone who deserves happiness, but in my current situation, I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do, or how to do it. I have no idea where to go from here, what options are out there for me, and I have nobody to help me.

I took a job recently for an administrative position in the Healthcare industry.

(I don't want to go into too much detail of the position on the post but I gladly can describe more responsibilities or give information privately if needed) I negotiated my wages based on the job listing and now I am starting to feel that either there was a listing error and they were excited to accept at a lower rate, or maybe even a bait and switch scenario happened.\nMy main questions are:\n\n\nHow do I properly discuss my salary concerns?

If the hospital needs to hire low skilled labor to provide some service to patients, even if the service is highly important or it comes with the title, Head of Whatever, the job isn't going to pay much.\nYour comp is based a lot more on you than the position. You have a value in the marketplace. Not every job is going to be a good fit for you.

(I did not have a doubt but now she has me nervous lol)\nAny advice? [/INST]",
        "prediction": " No, you should absolutely use a professional adviser. There are many reasons why:\n1) You need expertise that goes beyond what most people know from casual reading or high school economics classes. Most people don't understand the difference between \"investment\" and \"speculation.\"\n2) The adviser can help you make sure your overall strategy fits with your goals. If you want to be reasonably safe while still growing your wealth, there might be some things you would never consider doing on your own because they seem too risky; likewise, there may be things you wouldn't do on your own because they sound boring. An experienced pro knows how to balance these two competing needs.\n3) A good advisory firm does more than just pick mutual fund share class expense ratios. They take care of a lot of paperwork for you (like filling out forms to open new accounts), keep track of your progress towards retirement, rebalance your portfolio periodically when necessary, offer tax planning guidance, etc. All of this takes time and effort -- which means you could save thousands by working with someone who charges fees instead of spending hours trying to figure everything out yourself.\n4) It saves you stress! Whenever you see an advertisement saying \"Work directly with a financial planner!\" you should think \"That sounds great until you realize that person probably doesn't actually work full-time as a financial planner, nor has any real experience helping clients manage their finances,\" so chances are whatever you're considering is much less likely to cause problems down the line.",
        "answer_1": "[Throwaway account here]\nMy wife and I were in a similar situation a few years back, so here is some random advice for you to consider, for what it is worth:\n\n\n$1M seems like an insane amount of money, but it can go super-fast.  I recommend not buying anything for a while, and plan very carefully.  Pay off credit cards, though.  \n\n\nYea, you can get a cool car and a remodel on the house, etc., but you can also let that money work for you for a while via investments.  When we first got wind of our money, we made a plan, with some of it going towards a $80K Mercedes SUV, etc., and I am now in hindsight so super glad we didn't buy that kind of stuff.  Take your time to really plan - don't just make a list of what you want to buy.\n\n\nYou might be looking at \"Wealth Manager\" more so than \"Financial advisor\", though $1M is maybe a little low for that, I'm not sure.  We shopped around for wealth managers, had some recommendations from friends, etc., but ended up only having a small amount under that control, as kind of a secondary backup plan.  (We ended up with RBC Wealth Management\n\n\nReally get references for advisors and managers, and recognise that they may be looking more out for themselves than for you.\n\n\nRead all you can before making big decisions.  We read every single \"Investment For Dummies\" books.  I actually liked those a lot because the Dummies brand wants to protect their brand more than push an agenda.  Read them all.\n\n\nAnother absolute must read is \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham.  I have literally doubled our money by following this simple advice over about 3 or so years.  You will need to know the basics of investing, per the Dummies books, before reading this, but I strongly recommend it.  (Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffet's Mentor)\n\n\nConsider that with $1M you can now be an accredited investor.  That means, you can buy into various companies that are not publically traded.  This can be a lot of fun.  Learn about angel investing and the like, find some groups that do it, and if it is of interest to you, be very careful, picky, and spread your risk.   This is not for everyone, though, and very risky.   We personally have small investments ($2K to $15K) spread out over several such investments totaling maybe $50K.  It will be quite a few years before we know if that was a good idea, but they were companies that we felt were doing good in the world, so are okay losing it.\n\n\nKeep it to yourself.  Your friends don't need to know your good fortune.  All that would do is incite jealousy, which really is not something you want, as tempting as it may be.\n\n\nConsider always keeping a reserve so you can quit your job at any moment.  Having the knowledge that you always have that freedom may make your job more fun.  \n\n\nDon't forget others.  Share some of your good fortune.  Invest in the world around you.\n\n\nHope something here is of some help.  Congratulations on your good fortune.",

Our finance system is very different here in Australia, but I'm hoping I might be able to offer some useful advice. \nMost financial planners/advisors will be selling you products that make them the most money. Do your research on any advisor, ask them how they're paid (avoid any advisor that is paid by commission such as the one you mentioned you'd seen). Look for someone who will charge you a 'fee for service', preferably someone from an independent firm too. \nFind out if there is an industry body with a professional standard of conduct and education like the FPA in Australia. Get someone who has post graduate qualifications in finance also. You advisor should be extensively researching your situation as well as the products they're recommending so be wary of an advisor who doesn't ask lots of questions. \nThat being said, if you're intelligent and interested and willing to put the work in, you're better off doing it yourself.

Thank you so much in advance for your help!\nEDIT:  minor update here:    [/INST]",
        "prediction": " You shouldn't talk to any one of these until you determine what it is you want help with. Here they are, in order of importance:\n1) A CPA - If you just inherited $50k, this doesn't sound like enough money to warrant a fee-based financial advisor or planner. Your inheritance isn't large enough to justify paying a percentage of assets managed by anyone but a CFP. That said, a good accountant would be able to give you basic guidance on how to handle things from a tax perspective.\n2) An attorney - The fact that you think there might be taxes owed on this windfall means that there may well be legal implications. It sounds like you may not be aware that when you receive an \"inheritance,\" there are certain rules as to how it must be handled based upon who gave it to you.\n3) Your brother - This has nothing to do with finances at all. This is purely family dynamics. Do NOT rely on him for anything related to managing your money unless you really trust his judgment completely.",
        "answer_1": "Honestly, you should talk to a CFP - Certified Financial Planner.\nThese people have successfully completed a fairly lengthy certification process, and they will definitely be able to help you.\nAfter that, your question becomes whether you want to pay someone a fee for their services, or whether you will go with someone that works on commission.\nIf you don't mind dealing with someone on commission, then I would suggest getting in touch with a CFP from Northwestern Mutual or New York Life -- these are the two most prestigious and successful insurance mutuals in the US.  Meeting with someone like this would be free, but they will try to sell you whole-life insurance.  (As someone with experience in the insurance industry, let me say that whole-life insurance is great for some people, and a waste of money for others.)\nOn the other hand, if you want to pay a fee, then you just need to find someone that can help you with that.  If you want to go with this route, then I might first trying calling CPA firms to see if you can get someone who is a CPA and CFP to advise you.  (Obviously the price of this advising could change depending in your area, etc., but I would expect to pay around $500 to sit down with a CPA/CFP for a couple hours.",

[The government only looks at tangible assets, like the value of your home]( \nMost financial advisors begin to help people on a personal level at $25,000. But you might find someone that can give you advise for a set charge per/hour. Just call and ask. If you can find a tax attorney then that would be good. An accountant would help you out with taxes, but may not be able to advise you on where to put your money. I think you'll also have to do lots of research on your own: free research on the interwebs will only get you so far."

I guess I'll start by saying I blame no one for this but myself and I want to do everything possible to manage these loans. The bulk of my loans have been consolidated and are federal loans (70k consolidated. Currently doing income based repayment, these payments start next month)\nNow for the shitty part... I have 30k in private loans (gasp). 20k is to Sallie Mae and another 10k is actually a private loan from my university (How the hell I let that happen is beyond me. Freshman year I accepted the university's assistance because I could not pay my tuition. I was under the impression  this was another federal loan until my university called me yesterday to inform me payments were due in June). I called my university today in an attempt to sort this loan out and consolidate it... which failed miserably. \nI'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and helpless at the moment and I wish to change that. \nMy sallie mae payments start in May and will be 400 a month. My private university loan is due in june and will be 213 a month.\nI can expect another 200 a month in federal loan repayments. \nWith 800 a month coming out for student loans and an estimated 1000 dollars in monthly expenses, I can afford to exist and that's about it. \nI realize that this is the worst my situation will ever be (ideally). I will get established and my degree does have value (Environmental Science) I finally have my foot in the door at a company who will train me well and at the very least, make me more employable.\nDo I just ride this out and budget like I've never budgeted before? I am only making 15/hr right now but it is full time with decent health insurance, this pay will ideally increase to 20+ in 3-6 months when I am properly trained and coherent in my position. Im sure my situation is not unique and I'm sure many people have felt their debt was insurmountable. \nWhat can I do now to set myself up to succeed?

I'm 21 and work as a receptionist in Minneapolis for a luxury apartment business. I make $10 an hour, at a base of 30 hours a week. I've been working there for six months and because we're short staffed I've almost always hit around 45-60 hours a week with some great overtime. My best friend and I are eyeballing a few apartments in the cities that are around 900 or so a month, with us splitting the bill down the middle. I bring home about 1,300 monthly when I'm only getting minimum hours.\nI currently live at home with my mother and 22 year old brother. Both of us are taking a few years off of college (I have no college debt just yet to worry about) to save up money and get our ducks in a row. My main concern with moving out is not how I can manage financially, but how I can manage both my rent and her rent at the same time.\nMy mother is absolutely terrible with money. We live in a trailer with $580 rent, and she's always supported us with a boyfriend's income, or by borrowing money. She's been an artist her whole life and doesn't have many other job skills at 57 years old. She's also recently in remission for breast cancer and I can't let her overwork herself since she's at risk for relapse if she gets too stressed. I feel responsible for her since she's very scatter-brained and I'm concerned that she can't make it on her own since she's never had to do so before. \nMy brother and I pay most of the bills. She gets $700 a month for unemployment, but that won't cover the debt she's gotten herself into over the years, along with two cars and a huge electricity bill.  I think I make enough to survive on my own (especially with a roommate), but I need advice about how to deal with a dependent parent.\nTL;DR: Desperately want to move out of the nest, but don't know how to keep myself and my mother financially stable.

Anybody can learn to run a cash register. \nSee if there are county services for assistance in finding jobs especially for older/displaced workers. \nIf you are adamant about supporting her yourself, you need substantially better income.

It is a small complex, managed by an almost retired guy on behalf of his mother who is the owner.  She's pretty old and he is set to inherit the place when she finally dies.  Since it's a family owned thing we were told at the beginning to pay rent with cash, since it was easy for them.\nWe have been excellent tenants, in general the whole complex is very quiet and polite, and we have never been late with our rent or had any problems with them.  However, we are sensing that there may be some changes coming and the ownership/management of the complex might be handed down to the next generation son, who we do not like or trust.     At all! \nNothing bad has happened yet, but two very established families suddenly moved recently and we are a little concerned about the changes we see.  \nOur lease is month to month and we have never gotten rent reciepts, as it's difficult to even pay the property manager directly and we usually end up giving the money to his sweet old mother in law who also lives there and collects all the rent money for him.\nI'm also pretty sure they don't report to credit agencies, which kind of stinks for us. \nSo having briefly explained the situation, herein lies my questions:\nHow can I protect my family in case something bad happens?

[/INST]",
        "prediction": " A lot of people misunderstand what \"defensive\" means here: it doesn't mean that these companies are immune from recession or downturn - far from it. What it really means is that their businesses tend to be less cyclically sensitive than others. In other words, during an economic contraction (or even depression), many industries will see demand drop off dramatically. For example, if you have a company that makes airplanes, cars, home appliances, etc., then those things aren't going anywhere when times are tough; people can delay buying them sure, but there isn't much chance that people stop needing necessities altogether. The same goes with consumer staples: while some consumers may cut back on luxury items, they still need food & household goods.

No one will ever get mad at you for asking too much information.\n- The best place to start learning about personal finance is through the Boglehead wiki.

Getting paid roughly $35k a year to take care of my mom and I'm looking for any advice on what I should be doing money wise besides the obvious 'saving'.\nSince I'm getting paid to take care of my mom, I view my income as a blessing. Obviously my job isn't set in stone. It could go away in the blink of a eye, depending on my mother's health; if she has to go back to a nursing home, a hospital, etc.\nI've been employed officially since March 16th. For about a week I've been thinking nonstop on how I need to either grow my bank account with the paychecks I receive biweekly or at the very least just make it last in case of some unfortunate series of events.\nI'm lucky enough to not have any bills to worry about at the moment. My family knows if they need money for bills, groceries, etc. that they can ask and it's completely understandable.\nOnce I was employed I opened a Capital One checking account and recently have opened a Capital One savings account. I deposited $1500 into my savings to get it going.\nIs there anything specific you guys could recommend that I should be doing money wise? As you could guess I don't have much financial experience. \nThanks so much for taking your time to read this. I greatly appreciate it. [/INST]",
        "prediction": " First off, congratulations! Your situation is extremely rare: You are making an above-minimum wage salary without having finished high school, and still have the opportunity to save. This means you're way ahead of the game compared to most people who post here.\n\nFor about a week I've been thinking nonstop on how I need to either grow my bank account with the paychecks I receive biweekly or at the very least just make it last in case of some unfortunate series of events.\n\nThis is exactly right - you need to start saving now. The \"unfortunate series of events\" might include losing your job (which would mean no more income), but also your mother dying sooner than expected, her being injured requiring expensive medical treatment, her being diagnosed with a condition that requires long term care that eats up all of your available funds... basically, life. Having emergency savings will help protect you from these unexpected expenses.\nThe first step in building an emergency fund is to create a budget. Start by writing down every single thing you spend money on each month. Don't leave anything out - gas to drive somewhere, lunch, entertainment, Netflix, shampoo, whatever. If you can't write something down immediately, put it in a note app and come back later when you remember. Then add everything up. Divide that total number by 4. That's how much you should aim to save per pay period. Set up automatic transfers to hit your savings account each time you get paid.\nNext, open a Roth IRA through Vanguard. Contribute $5500 annually ($458/month). Once you reach age 25, contribute another $5500/year until retirement age. These contributions are made pretax, which means you won't see them on your tax return next April. However, because they are invested in stock market funds instead of cash, they will eventually become tax free after age 59 1/2.\nFinally, once you have your budget set up and are contributing to both your savings and IRAs, consider opening a brokerage account where you can invest excess money. A good starting point is to look at a target date fund like VTSAX, which tracks the S&P 500 index.",

        "answer_1": "I'm a research psychologist, and I sat in on a graduate-level economics course in which several inconvenient psychological truths, so to speak, were casually dismissed by the econ professor running the course.

At the same time, several of the empirical econ studies discussed in the course used a casual examination of different modal responses, absent any significance tests, to claim support for predictions. And the instructor remarked more than once (only half-jokingly) that he believed that 10% - 20% of any given sample of students was always \"off the reservation,\" acting contrary to rational predictions for entirely unpredictable reasons.\nWhile I took a lot away from that course, my confidence in empirical economics took a bit of a dive.

But I want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. \nWhat is a credit freeze?\nA credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. It protects you against identity theft. Even if a hacker knows all your info, including your SSN, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. Now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. Once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.\nOther replies:\nWhy is this news important now?\nMany experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. Starting Friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. In the wake of a massive data breach last year at Equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million Americans, Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. Equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. [The bill was passed in May](  [It is effective as of today.]( \nHow can I do it?\nTo set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: \n[Experian]( \n[Equifax]( \n[TransUnion](  \n[ChexSystems]( \n[Innovis] ( \n[NCTUE] ( \nYou will be given a PIN that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. \nDo I have to do this with all credit agencies? I only have one credit card\nYes you do. Your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. \nDoes this mean that I can freeze my credit score at 810? Does freezing affect my score?\nNo. A credit freeze only freezes who can see your credit record. Your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. Freezing does not affect your score.\nIs credit unfreeze/thaw also free?\n[Yes.]( \nHow long does the \u201cthaw\u201d process takes before credit is available to be pulled?\nIf you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.\nWhat if I lose my PIN?

If yes, then you might consider temporary arrangements until things settle down.\nContact the executor listed in the obituary / death notice / whatever they use these days (if one exists), or reach out to the funeral director directly, and ask when they expect to release the estate information. The estate needs to be settled by the Executor, usually through an attorney, since your Mom doesn't have much money other than what's in the house and maybe retirement accounts. In CA, most estates don't require formal administration unless assets exceed ~$150k, but you shouldn't assume that without more info.\nIf nothing else, look into getting power of attorney for healthcare decisions while you try to get everything sorted out. At least temporarily, your mom won't be able to make important medical decisions for herself.",
        "answer_1": "Talk to a social worker at the hospital about adult social services for your mom and legal advice for you about how to handle your dad's estate going forward. I'm sorry for your loss.",
        "answer_2": "You have two choices when it comes to your mother:\n1) Be there until the end of her days. You become her full-time carer\n2) You have someone do it for yo  in old people's home.\nI'm not gonna go in and ask about mental illnesses but if she's not aware of her surroundings as much as she used to, putting in a people's home with professional carers etc is the best outcome, because it will impact your life and probably put it on a standstill if you decide to care for you mother 24/7"
